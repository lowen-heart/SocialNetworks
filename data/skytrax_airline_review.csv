british-airways;Donna Miller;United States;2015-08-01;Considering BA's fares were high to begin with and you had to purchase your seats to secure in advance we still booked on the advice of our British son in law. Plane is so large takes a long time to board and disembark. We flew Premium Economy, seats are bigger and have leg room but they're not comfortable for some reason. Flight crew was fine and professional. Inflight entertainment was fine but new movie selection was small. Cabin and seats were clean and neat. Inflight kit consisted of socks, ear plugs, mask, pen and tiny toothpaste and brush.  They offer pillows and blankets. But although the seats are wider, they weren't easy to get in and out of, and not just us a number of passengers contorted just to get out. The meals were fine, though served on a tiny tray loaded with food, the meal was pretty good. Not a lot of choices, to London, beef or pasta, from London back to LA, it was beef or fish. It was hot and there was a lot of food, a salad, small  cheese and  crackers. Roll butter and dessert but I'm not sure I'd say it was what BA's advertisement claims. It didn't feel it was a premium meal. They also served snacks but it was flashed on the overhead with no explanation of where to go to get the snacks. The entire plane was dark. The second meal was a breakfast, but not especially appealing. On the return to LA, it was a very odd casserole, rather dry and bland. The flight was smooth and arrived on time, coming back we were an hour late waiting as the pilot informed us of sixty passengers arriving late from Germany. They lost one of our suitcases enroute, we arrived on Thursday afternoon, the bag was delivered late Friday night to our hotel, no offer to help with expense of having to buy what was needed until bag was found. Not even an email or text, we finally asked the hotel who said it arrived midnight Friday, we weren't notified by BA until Saturday afternoon. We ended up spending quite a lot buying shirts, underwear and shorts to get by. If we'd known they had found the bag we wouldn't have spent the money. Poor communication on their part. Not an apology or sorry for the inconvenience. I guess they figured we should be grateful we got the bag at all. I doubt we'd fly BA again sadly I'd hoped for something special.;Premium Economy;7.0;2.0;5.0;4.0;4.0;3.0;0
british-airways;C Lindsay;United Kingdom;2015-08-01;We flew Business Class to Vienna on the 28/7/15, Terminal 3 is a dismal place and the lounge reflected this. There was very poor food choices and everything was tired including the staff. The outward journey was okay, flight attendant was pleasant. I think the meal choices could be improved - these tickets are not cheap. However the return flight (31/7/15) which was in economy - also not cheap, was not good at all. The attitude of the staff was really below par. The food choice was an iced bun and a chicken/bacon bun. Seeing the choice I asked for the vegetarian option-Couscous with a few slices of pepper - all of which were tasteless.  When asked would I like a drink I replied - Bloody Mary. I should have known better, as this was the attendant who having to do a live safety demo chewed and smirked the whole way through, produced the drink without any WS. I asked if I could have some and then watched him add a good 1cm to the drink - turning the tomato juice a dark brown. BA need to remember we as the customers pay their wages.;Economy;3.0;3.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;2.0;0
british-airways;John Durkin;Australia;2015-08-01;The staff were great, food was pretty good, their seating policy is a sham. For that reason I'd never fly with BA again. I have issues with arthritis and they changed my Aisle seat to a window seat at the last moment and I had to endure no room to move for most of our flight from London to Sydney.;Economy;3.0;1.0;4.0;4.0;3.0;1.0;0
british-airways;John Bradley;United Kingdom;2015-07-31;Short trip to Vienna in BA Economy Class from Terminal 3. New A320 cabin on the flight out - looks nice and fairly comfortable for a couple of hours. Other than the cheap, highly processed cheese and ham croissant and a coffee you are given it is no different to a low cost airline. Staff service minimal - they served breakfast and collected the leftovers, basically in the cabin twice during the entire 2 hour and 10 minute flight - not even an additional beverage service. I'm sure if they were flogging the drinks it would be different. Return a couple of days later, older aircraft but clean. Same indifferent service, similar processed carbs handed out in silence and 1 drink. This wasn't a cheap ticket (over 200GBP) - I know BA are competing with low cost airlines in Europe but when are they going to realise they aren't a low cost airline? A bit of chat from the staff and a couple of extra coffees would have made all difference to how I felt leaving those flights. BA sadly seem to be falling behind the crowd.;Economy;4.0;4.0;2.0;2.0;0.0;2.0;0
british-airways;B Stauffer;South Africa;2015-07-31;British Airways Business Class product has not really changed over the last 15 years, and they are now far behind competition in seat comfort (half of the passengers must still fly facing backwards) and entertainment. What once made BA a great airline was the cabin crew who treated their passengers like guests. Unfortunately, they are slowly retiring and replaced by younger employees who could care or less about high revenue passengers. On this particular flight, the cabin was half full, but the crew rushed the service to an extent I have never seen before: the pre-dinner drinks were served, and less than 5 minutes later, I was served the first course. I did not even start the salad when the plate was taken away and I was presented with a beef fillet that was totally overcooked. Ten minutes later, the trays were taken away, and the lights dimmed. We did not see the crew again for the next 9 hours, and no water or juice were ever served. Unfortunately BA has the only non-stop flight between Cape Town and London, but next time I will fly Emirates via Dubai even if that means adding 4 hours to the trip.;Business Class;2.0;2.0;1.0;2.0;2.0;1.0;0
british-airways;Yang Zhou;South Korea;2015-07-29;Had a very unpleasant experience with BA this time. They changed our family seats without warning. First time flying with two babies, booked the ticket and reserved two seats together sitting together with husband. Both babies are lap seat. Two days before the flight I called the BA service to make sure our seats and ticket are all fine and got a positive answer. On the day of boarding found out out seats are moved apart. For 12 hours flight, our family seats are arranged far apart. After more than 40 minutes standing at the counter waiting for the coordination, we could sit across the aisle when we get on the plane. No food for my 2 year old. If we are not allowed to bring food onto the plane, what do BA expect baby can eat? No help from staff with any service. When babies are crying and very restless  we didn't get any help from BA staff. When I flew with other airlines, flight attendant brought small toys to help distract and entertain baby. BA forgot to unload out stroller when we landed.;Premium Economy;4.0;2.0;1.0;2.0;0.0;3.0;0
british-airways;Michaël Steiner;Switzerland;2015-07-29;This was my return flight of my trip in the USA. From Europe to the USA we had an Airbus A380 which was modern and quite enjoyable to fly. My return flight was on a Boeing 747. The aircraft was quite old with seats which weren't so comfortable but at least fully OK. The flight was good, cabin crew were friendly, sometimes  absent in the cabin and not very happy when you asked them something.  The food was OK, not gastronomic but acceptable in an economy class. We had delays of 35 minutes by landing, so the flight were quite on time, though that the longest delay was due of an engine problem. I recommend British Airways even for short flights (if you book early and fares not too high) than for longer ones. One reason more is that connections in Heathrow are easy when you have two BA flights, transfer done in 35mins.;Economy;7.0;4.0;3.0;3.0;4.0;4.0;1
british-airways;Eamon Callan;United Kingdom;2015-07-28;I have flown in business class with BA on many occasions and found the service to be hit and miss. If you get an indifferent crew - which, in my experience, is not far off half the time - they want you to eat your dinner as fast as possible, go to sleep and not bother them any more. Once such a crew spot the blankets coming out they cease interest in you, never check on you, and leave you to ask for everything. I have never had that experience in business class with other airlines, for example Emirates, EVA or Lan Chile, quite the opposite. Anyway, BA were offering a special price to upgrade (cash only) to first on my Vancouver-Heathrow flight. I thought I'd try it. It was a waste of money. The first sign of trouble was the fact that I was not welcomed or addressed by name - an absolute must I think. Then the (male, and they tend to be the worst on BA, I am sorry to say) flight attendant came round handing out menus as though we were in economy - he just doled them out rather than hand them to, and speak to, each passenger in a personal manner. The wine selection didn't seem so very much better than business class and when I asked a specific question (flavour of champagne) the flight attendant didn't know the answer. I eat slowly and was still on my main course (lamb, and rather dry) when the dreaded time arrived for the blankets to make their appearance. I thought 'Oh no, surely not in first'. Well, I was wrong. I was left staring at my dirty plate and eventually had to summon the flight attendant and ask to see the menu for dessert. After that, unbelievably, I was abandoned again and, in protest, got up from my seat and went off in search of a crew member. I asked to speak to the cabin services director (female, delighful manner) who was full of apologies, of course, and off I went back to my seat. When I was finally given coffee, the flight attendant who brought it (another female) confided that BA don't have the staff numbers to pay the same attention to first or business passengers that some other airlines do, I couldn't believe my ears. As for the cabin, being in the nose of the 747,I felt cramped. The mood-changing lighting doesn't compensate for the dark, monotone blue of the seats and carpet. The in-light entertainment was to my surprise just the same as on the rest of the plane. I know this reads like a demolition job on BA but I have made no exaggerations. I really think Willie Walsh should don a false beard and shades and take a decent number of flights in business and first on his own planes. He'd find out for himself. I want BA to be the best and it simply isn't. Lastly, my experience of the hit and miss service of BA business class is shared by every other person I have ever mentioned it to. If you're flying BA stay in business class, you're not missing anything.;First Class;2.0;4.0;1.0;3.0;1.0;1.0;0
british-airways;Dave Houlihan;United Arab Emirates;2015-07-27;This review is written due to what I feel is true reflection of the decline of a once great airline. Check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. The first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff I have ever come across. The lounge was fine, but it is looking tired. Service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. No priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). Opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. Staff very pleasant, professional, and very helpful. Food ok not First class, wines good. The entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. The seat would not lie flat and hard to move. Bought on board duty free and asked would I need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. Deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to, given wrong directions to the lounge. Had to clear immigration although not entering the UK, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free I bought on board could not go through I would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. This was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. Connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited at the gate. Flight to Dublin short, salad served and tea. Priority bags were the last bags on the belt. Overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. I fly 12-14 times a year and gold level. BA you have lost your edge, I will stay loyal to Qatar, Emirates and Cathay Pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business. My advice do not waste your money with BA, it's service cutting to the point of insult.;First Class;1.0;2.0;3.0;2.0;1.0;1.0;0
british-airways;A Gibson;United Kingdom;2015-07-27;"Quick online check-in and boarding passes with the BA mobile APP. It is so easy to use and definitely helps you to get rid of those annoying loose bits of paper from your cabin bags. Manchester Airport Terminal 3 is bursting at the seams during the summer holiday mornings. There's a severe lack of seats in this terminal but despite this, the security check didn't take too long at all. The BA ground staff at Manchester seemed friendly enough and boarded strictly in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front. This helps stop the queuing in the aisles onboard to get to your seat. We were greeted at the aircraft door by a couple of cheerful and friendly crew. The refreshed cabin now looks very modern, welcoming and clean. The comfort of the new seats and the space on this aircraft (A321) I feel would be more than sufficient for a flight of 2-3 hours or so (I'm 5ft 11""). With a fully loaded cabin and a flight time to Heathrow of just over 30 minutes the crew were quick into action. We were offered a hot breakfast bacon wrap, orange juice and tea or coffee, perfect for such a short flight and definitely helps set BA apart from the competition. The flight arrived into Terminal 5 a few minutes ahead of schedule and outside the UK Arrivals area less than ten minutes later.";Economy;10.0;4.0;5.0;5.0;0.0;5.0;1
british-airways;Linda Wilson;United Kingdom;2015-07-27;I am a very frequent long haul traveller and although I will often choose the Asian carriers (e.g. Singapore Airlines, JAL, Cathay) over British Airways, being based in London means that I do often fly with BA. I find BA's long haul business class offering though innovative when it was launched in the 90s has now been way outclassed by many of its competitors. The seats don't quite lie flat (and it's not unusual to get a broken seat) and half the passengers have to go backwards and climb over other passengers to get out - I can't think of any other major airline that has this any more in business class. I am told by a BA contact that they considered changing the configuration for the A380s, but didn't in the end. Worst of all, I find the onboard service incredibly inconsistent - most often it's a little begrudging, occasionally it is excellent and sometimes it is downright awful. I was particularly annoyed at my customer service experience on a flight from LHR to Tokyo Haneda, when settling down in my seat, I looked down to find a dirty napkin, used earplugs and toothpick and significant quantities of broken glass around my feet (good job I hadn't taken my shoes off at this stage). My husband flagged down a member of cabin crew, who said she would come and clear it, but didn't. I flagged down the Cabin Services Director who did bring a dustpan and brush and said he would report it. Upon my return, I complained to BA. After three weeks, they deigned to reply, but it was on the lines of 'our cabins are always cleaned to the highest standards, we are sorry you didn't find this to your liking' - effectively implying that I was making a fuss over nothing.;Business Class;3.0;1.0;2.0;4.0;4.0;4.0;0
british-airways;K Weller;United Kingdom;2015-07-26;Booked for our trip to Uganda, in Feb 2015 we spent £1450 for 2 return tickets, had to pay an additional £100 to reserve seats on the flights. About 2 days ago I received a text message (not a call) saying that our flight had been cancelled - left us in the dark until I had to phone their 0844 number to get transferred to a Delhi call centre, when I was told I could get a full refund they tried to only refund me for the flights and not the seats on this now, non existant flight. I had to phone back a further 2 times to get through to someone that could understand that I did want my £100 as well.

british-airways;Bob Motto;United Kingdom;2015-07-25;Flew Club Europe from Istanbul to Heathrow, excellent flight with quick and easy boarding.

british-airways;Bob Motto;United Kingdom;2015-07-25;Flew Club Europe to Istanul on 767, boarding was speedy and boarding completed quickly for an on time departure. The flight was excellent and the crew in Club Europe were as always providing excellent service and professional at all times. Although the 767 is showing its age, I still prefer this aircraft to the A320's which also are used on this route, on the 767 at least the Club Europe seats are comfortable and offer plenty of leg room unlike the new Club Europe which is used on the A320's which is in reality going back to the days of charter airlines! So come on British Airways lets go back to the old configurations where we have plenty of leg room in Club Europe and reduce the rows of seats, we do not want Low Cost Airline look alikes otherwise we would fly them, we choose BA because we are loyal to you so bring back your old standards once again.;Business Class;9.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;3.0;5.0;1
british-airways;Lawrence Hunt;United Kingdom;2015-07-25;"BA seems to be losing its ability to run an airline. I have had 4 flights canclled in the last 3 months, 3 of them while I was at the gate. Every flight which does operate is delayed. Staff attitude is appallimg, they just don't seem to care. I have no compensation. My step daughter was deinied boarding due to BA overbooking.

british-airways;Eric Rose;United Kingdom;2015-07-25;"Previously a loyal BA customer, I Usually travel economy on shorthaul but I am 6'4"" with long legs and am very uncomfortable unless I can get Exit row. So on this flight I took advantage of a what I thought was a reasonably priced Club World ticket expecting the past 34 inch seat pitch. Horrified to find on boarding that BA have reduced the seat pitch to 30 inch - exactly the same as in economy. The presence of an empty middle seat and pathetic little table for your tablet computer is no compensation. Fortunately this was a short flight but even so I was extremely uncomfortable. Cabin staff and other passengers said there had been loads of complaints but clearly BA don't care. I sometimes go to Cyprus and the thought of a 4 hr+ flight in these cramped seats puts me off totally. The meal was passable but as the flight took off a couple of minutes before midday it was classed as ""late breakfast"" and no wine was served. It is clear that BA are putting profit over customer service and I am amazed that anyone travels Club Europe. Later in the year I was due to travel to South America via Madrid in Business Class but have now cancelled and switched to another airline. In future I will avoid BA shorthaul wherever possible.";Business Class;1.0;1.0;4.0;2.0;0.0;1.0;0
british-airways;Alan Thompson;United Kingdom;2015-07-23;Booked a hand luggage only fare at short notice so it was pricey. Allocated a decent seat but amazed at charge of €26 to change it so didn't bother. Flight seemed to be full of families split up probably for the same reason. A ripoff. Flight was late, usual excuse of late arrival from a previous flight. Flight deck crew affable. Food and drink good and free, a bonus. Cabin attendants, an older purser up front a bit patronising. The two in economy were really going through the motions, no eye contact and perfunctory service. 1 drink served in a 2.5 hour flight. For the last hour the two at the back were eating Club Europe meals which I saw them bring from the front. This was BA2591 on 22 July. Not great.;Economy;7.0;4.0;1.0;4.0;0.0;3.0;1

I was allocated seat 11A which had the tightest leg-room I have experienced, luckily it was only a short 50 min flight.

Heathrow T3 departure experience is quite shoddy compared to T2 or main BA flights out of T5. Service onboard the flight was perfunctory at best, and staff seem to perform to a script - in some cases portray the feeling that because they wear a BA uniform they think they are so excellent - a sad fact is their standards are below several major European airlines. The Purser, CSD (or whichever grand title they give to cabin staff) on outbound flight spent a lot of time giggling in the galley like a 6 year old child, and then proceeded to make the PA announcements in the campest and most disrespectful tone of voice - again, this seemed to be done for the amusement of his fellow t-d's.

This being said, after my first flight with BA when my luggage stayed in Tampa and didn't make it to the UK until four days after I'd arrived, I stayed fairly calm. Mistakes are made. My flight had been canceled (which seems like commonplace at BA), and was re-booked after only three hours on the phone. When I ventured to take my trip home, I was notified via text message that my flight had been canceled yet again. After speaking to a calm man about my horrible experience thus far, he informed me of a customer care number that I could call and complain about my flight. Let's remember I'm a teacher, and I also payed $1,800 for this trip. That's an entire months pay just so we all know. I'm meant to leave tomorrow and still have not received confirmation via email.

Inflight entertainment was good and updated to latest movies, documentaries, talk shows 5* for that. The seating space was just about good enough. Be careful of the head set it can get in the way and snap. The air conditioner was not up to the mark so it was warm in the cabin. The inflight food was extremely hot, in short it was burnt. The answer from the flight crew when someone asked for a second helping of 150ml coke can is that they needed to keep stock for the return flight.

Inflight entertainment was alright, but do take note to always unplug the headset whenever you get out of your seat. It damages easily if it gets caught on something. I had to change 2 headsets because of that, because being in a aisle seat, you have to get off when someone wants to use the lavatory, thus remember to unplug it if you intend to get up from your seat. Service was alright. I requested for eye shades, and it came about 1hr later, crew must have forgotten about my request. I didn't pursue it as I thought I could just head to the back galley and request for them after my movie. In terms of food, it was appalling and greasy. Overall, I will not say never again, but given a choice, I'd look out for Singapore Airlines first, then the big 3 Gulf carriers.

I suspect the plane might have seen better days given that the entertainment system was ancient - no games, small screen compared with the likes of Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. Some cost cutting evident - no menus, hot towels, metal cutlery - which is fine by me.

BA should be commended for retaining 9-abreat seating in the 777, legroom is adequate and adjustable headrest is a nice touch. AVOD was decent, with clear screen, though movie selection was not extensive. Catering was marginal on the outbound flight from Atlanta, with breakfast ""croissant"" being inedible, however, much better on the inbound flight from London.

On past sectors the older crew took the time to know you and, as a frequent flyer, even say thanks for choosing BA. Hung clothes returned crushed. The dinner was the same as Jet Airways domestic economy. Breakfast at 03.30 a bit of fruit, tepid tea, pastry and egg roll served out of alfoil.

Crew professional, no WIFI, just repeat that no WIFI, food selection limited as they had a 'catering issue'. If I booked and paid for First Class I shouldn't have to hear they had a catering issue. I had the sampler selection without the wine coupling. The portion were small so had to ask for more food from a la carte, overall the food was not fantastic.

We had front row seats 10A and 10B, 10A window seat is reverse facing and 10B is an aisle forward facing seat, the seats were very comfortable and we got a solid 8 hours sleep. We were concerned that seat 10B would get disturbance from the galley and washroom which were in front of it, however, this was not the case and would recommend this seat, it also has no one stepping over you to get out of their seat, seat 10A gives good privacy if needed by raising the divider, but you do have to step over the legs of the person in seat 11B to get out, not a huge problem but sometimes difficult when dark. Very attentive and cheery cabin crew, they maintained this good level of service for the full 13hour flight. The food was just about acceptable, champagne was offered pre take off and during flight, wine selections ok. I would be happy to travel BA Club World again on this 777-200 aircraft in seats 10AB or 10JK, but I do prefer the Upper Deck on the 747, sad will be the day they retire the good old Jumbo, I'm not a lover of the new A380.;Business Class;8.0;4.0;5.0;3.0;4.0;5.0;1
british-airways;Charles Kemp;United Kingdom;2015-07-17;LHR-BKK-LHR. Started badly with all the Ryanairesque baggage warnings at Terminal 5. BA's low 23kg baggage allowance had me nervy. Seating offered less legroom than competitors and seat not very comfy. Outward food superb, best economy meal I've had in a long time. Return trip horrible. At check-in I was under 30kg but over the 23kg derisory BA limit. Was asked for £65 more but declined. When I quoted Thai Airways 30kg limit I was invited to buy a ticket with them. So I had to put on loads of clothes and dump a few cheap items to get my boarding pass. On the plane I had to sit next to a very fat man (not BAs fault) and the food was disgusting. Some rubber chicken with four strips of gravy-sodden potato wedges. No vegetables. Second meal only accompanied by tasteless square of sponge. No salad, yoghurt or other goodies. Between the 2 meals a goody box was given out with an oat bar and a few other bits which was nice. IFE had the smallest screen I have ever seen, and a poor choice of films. Return flight journey progress constantly broke down. Generally, a poor experience considering BA's prices. Will not be using BA again.;Economy;2.0;1.0;2.0;3.0;1.0;1.0;0
british-airways;Richard Wilson;United Kingdom;2015-07-17;LHR-NCL-LHR economy on newly refitted Airbus narrowbody. The seats have so little legroom, it has the feeling of a budget airline (far from budget prices!) but OK for a short flight. The problem is this seat configuration is used throughout Europe and it's possible to be in such cramped conditions for a longer flight. Upgrading to business isn't a solution as there's no extra legroom on these planes. Have flown both Swiss and Norwegian in the past few weeks as well. Both had more legroom. Would recommend Norwegian (great airline - cheap, comfy, free wifi) but not Swiss (dreadful customer service). BA cabin staff continue to be very mixed : some attentive, polite and helpful. Others are downright rude (as one was on this flight) Overall, BA can be great, but sometimes not so much.;Economy;5.0;2.0;3.0;3.0;0.0;3.0;1
british-airways;Bob Motto;United Kingdom;2015-07-16;Recently flew BA from LHR to ORD, 64A, Upper Deck in Club World. Excellent experience with great service and a good food selection too. The crew were professional and very attentive but the ration of crew to passengers hels as there are only 20 seats on the upper deck with two dedicated crew. The seat was comfortable with plenty of room and storage under the windows was a great help too. The inflight entertainment was OK but the selection was very limited compared to what it used to be, BA could do more to add a much wider variety to its film selection, otherwise a great flight.;Business Class;10.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;3.0;5.0;1

british-airways;Pauline James;United States;2015-07-15;I was amazed that this airline charges extra to book a seat in advance. I have never seen that on any of the non-discount carriers, especially in business class. When I pay for a business seat I expect that seat section will be free and I won't be charged for another $147. The b-class is not uncomfortable, just configured weirdly, with little storage space near the seat. The FAs have to constantly lean over the person in the aisle to get to the person at the window, which is annoying and probably makes extra work for them. The food was flat out lousy-it looked like bad microwave fare. The service was OK, nothing special. Although I wasn't going to watch any in-flight entertainment, I did check it out.

However, when we have paid to sit next to each other, and paid for the opportunity to book seats in advance, you would expect the seating plan for the aircraft to clearly show where all the toilets and galleys are so that as the paying customer we would have a choice as to whether to is near them particularly on a long haul flight, on this occasion British Airways failed miserably. The plane was new and the seats were comfortable and spacious enough, not the upper deck in ecconomy. However being seated next to the toilets was not the best location, particularly as we had pre booked the seats online. The service was excellent and the staff helpful and happy to be there.

It reduces the number of staff for bag drop to the barest minimum. Business class bag drop at 08:30 at Heathrow had mostly empty desks and a queue resulting in a quite unacceptable wait of more than 15 minutes. Then having raced through security, there was the almost inevitable flight delay, only this time the 40-minute delay to the incoming aircraft was a result, we were told, of someone forgetting to tow the plane on to the stand from another part of the airport! With flights taking off to the west, there was yet another 20 minutes delay during taxiing. Only crisps or a couple of sweet biscuits were offered along with drinks.

If you know the huge distance between terminal 3 and 5 at Heathrow, you'll know just how much effort the flight attendant put in to returning the handbag. That exceptional level of customer service is almost unheard of these days, so BA get a 100% customer care rating from my wife and I. Snacks were good given it was only a bit over 3 hours flying time. Aircraft was clean, however the only negative was the Business Class seats, in fact the tiny cramped seats was the only thing that BA should really change as it sort of killed an otherwise perfect journey. They were standard Economy Class seats cramped in tight so your knees were pressing into the seat in front.

Fair enough if they want to charge for pre-booking of seats, but at least they should allow selection at check-in time in line with their direct competitors on the same route (Aer Lingus). I have also found the service (food, drinks etc) extremely poor for the fare charged, even for the short sector. If they continue their money-grabbing policy I will definitely and happily give more of my business to Aer Lingus and Cityjet which operate the same route and seem to not treat their customers as infinite cash cows.;First Class;3.0;2.0;1.0;1.0;0.0;1.0;0

We paid extra for our Premium Economy tickets, then extra again to reserve seats, and past experience with BA and with equivalent seats/service on Virgin Atlantic had led us to expect value for money and some small rewards for the extra costs. Not this flight, however, where the only real benefit appeared to be a small amount of extra legroom. We were last to board after First, Business and Economy. Where customers in Premium Economy used to be greeted with the choice of a glass of fizz or orange juice, now it is water or juice. Once we had taken off, drinks were served; fine, but when the steward came to collect the empty glass/bottle, he knocked the glass onto the floor, where it broke - the staff were all rushed and seemed to be short on numbers perhaps? I was made to feel that the breakage was my fault! Dinner did not arrive until after 11pm, by which time I had rather lost interest, as had my partner. So far, our extra costs had bought us extra leg room and one glass of wine (I was not offered a second, possibly because of my crime of causing the steward to break a glass). Overnight, by contrast to other night flights, the lights were never fully dimmed; there were no offers of water/orange juice to prevent dehydration. The promised (on the menu card) morning 'light snack' and coffee/tea/fruit juice was a hastily delivered piece of dried-up cake and a weak coffee - no mention of fruit juice. I couldn't really see what my extra costs were getting me that those in Economy had for less - the extra leg room was rather negated by the passenger in front's fully reclined seat. I will not, if at all possible, be travelling with BA again. It left a rather sour taste at the end of our holiday.";Premium Economy;3.0;3.0;2.0;2.0;3.0;1.0;0
british-airways;John Duffus;Thailand;2015-06-28;"Check in at Tegel was a disaster and ludicrously (for it has a lot of BA flights) I was told there are no BA staff at that airport to sort out problems. 100 minutes prior to departure, 2 check in desks were open - 1 business, 1 economy. As a BA Silver card holder, I joined the business queue. First one lady had considerably too much baggage. The arguments went on for more than 10 minutes before she paid the extra fees. Then the technical crew for a pop event the previous day had to be checked in. Not only were some of their 20 or so items very overweight, others were way too large. After 20 more minutes I asked a young lady why the other business passengers could not be processed at the economy desk. This was not possible, I was told. Eventually another economy desk opened; yet our queue remained immobile for a further 15 minutes. Finally after more than 40 minutes, someone decided we could be processed at an economy desk after all! Looking forward to a drink in the lounge, I then discover there is no lounge airside. As for the LHR-ORD flight, I have been spoiled with business class intercontinental travel since business class was introduced. To board an international carrier and discover a seat pitch of just 31"" was a major shock. This is like travelling long haul on a budget carrier only at considerably greater cost. The worst part was the cabin was kept at an extremely warm temperature throughout despite requests for the captain to reduce it to a more reasonable level. The meal was OK and the IFE had a decent selection of movies. But overall, the flight was hugely uncomfortable. With some other carriers still offering a seat pitch greater than 31"", BA has lost my future business.";Economy;2.0;1.0;3.0;2.0;3.0;1.0;0

british-airways;John Gray;United Kingdom;2015-06-26;It appears BA continues to adopt a “do as little as possible” for this route, presumably due to their monopoly. The aircraft and cabin is looking tired/old, and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flights with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. Outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy. It had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably grimy carpet. Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but mediocre IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal service was good for food and drink, although dirty environment was off-putting. Lacto Veg’ meal much improved since last tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro, but some nice ice cream. Return in 1K, and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. I'm ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. Tired, so skipped dinner. Decided to watch a short TV programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although even less programme choice. I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode, but got five hours of sleep. The cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for breakfast, so when attendants were offering bacon rolls I asked for my wife and my requested Lacto Veg Meals. Staff returned ashen faced, and profusely apologising, with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread rolls. Such bad service, and a lack of joined-up thinking! You couldn’t make it up.

The menu was identical to the outbound and the beef main course was was terrific. It was the sort of meal that I would have happily paid £20 for in a quality bistro. FAs were great. The Chinese FA was the sort that understand customer service. Her colleague was closer to retirement and seemed to be on another planet most of the time.

The cabin crew did offer cold water to keep all passengers cool, and delay was only around 20 minutes. Once airborne, drinks and snacks were served. Seating on A319 was comfortable for a short flight. At GLA Airport the parking stands  are so far away from the main terminal and pick up points, and changes to the airport in the past couple of years have increased the walking distance.

Originally my return flight was from Rome to London Gatwick but my flight was cancelled due to issues at Rome airport. But instead of BA getting in contact with me in regards to this, the third party company I booked the flights with had to. When Checking in they tried to charge me for baggage again although already paid for. When I  spoke to them on the phone, they just tried to fob me off to other numbers even though I called the Customer Service number. This is a shame because for once the actual flight and flight service was good which is surprising.

I find the business lounge in Geneva quite reasonable and on this last occasion was impressed with the manner in which the Lounge Manager handled a cranky passenger who was accusing him of destroying her favourite newspapers. Then, once on-board, I discovered that Business Class on some of BA's European routes have a seat-pitch that almost prevents gaining entry to the window seats! For those used to flying Qantas domestic economy in Australia think of a forward seat in economy with the middle seat kept empty: and that's it! On the other hand, service and food was excellent and the flight crew commentary was superb. BA have an excellent in-flight magazine.;Business Class;7.0;2.0;5.0;4.0;4.0;4.0;1

Check-in was fine, and cabin staff attentive, food average - but I do have an issue with space. The 747 fuselage tapers at the back - there's not enough room for 3-4-3 seating, and rows 51 on have 2-4-2 configuration. Rows 49/50 don't have enough room for 3-4-3 seating either, but BA do it anyway by sneakily making the outer seats narrower than the rest. I endured a 9 hour night flight in one of these horrible seats, my back was twisted and sore for weeks after. This is just not acceptable for a long-haul flight, especially at night - BA charges extra for seats identified as having more room, by the same principle these seats should be advertised as having less room and cash-back offered for anyone prepared to accept them (small children, perhaps).;Economy;3.0;1.0;4.0;3.0;3.0;2.0;0

I was rather disappointed to learn that my early morning Sunday flight was cancelled without any reason on the afternoon before the morning I was to fly - the whole point of this trip was so I could easily go back and return the same day to attend my sisters wedding, saving time and also money due to the trains being so expensive. I managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed I had to now arrange last minute accommodation, I thought this would be straightforward and as far as re-booking it was via the BA app. What it didn't tell me was that the flight I re-arranged to fly out with was severely delayed and my heart sank as I received a a text/app notification telling me so - I think this was very sneaky not to mention before re-booking and I spent a couple of hours getting to know Terminal 5. The general feedback from here and from friends is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation, and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable - more than anything when everything else is cutback, reliability becomes golden. The plane itself was immaculately maintained and clean and I liked the simple but elegant cabin. BA staff also do let things down a bit, often quite brusque and unfriendly, and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issues as there was here.

During the flight the handle of the toilet flew off, one of the overhead bins was loose and the table holding the bassinette was broken. The carpet was threadbear and the equipment was being held together with tape. They did not have enough food, and nothing available for me (I have a nut allergy), the food that was served, was not fit for human consumption. The toilets were not cleaned during the whole flight (13 hours), and as a result the smell from there was disgusting. The rubbish bin was overflowing with waste, which included soiled nappies. The only time we saw the cabin crew was when they were serving food. They looked very scruffy, not what you would expect of a BA cabin crew. All in all a very unpleasant flight.

There was however a good selection of drinks and glasses were topped up as required. Inflight entertainment was excellent, with a great range of both movies and TV shows.

Arrived on a Norwegian flight from Stockholm at Gatwick the day before and were able to check in luggage the evening before the flight to avoid any delays, next day very quiet, efficient check-in in economy section. Missed Club World check-in. Next day very efficient priority security straight to lounge. Very crowded but found seats eventually.

Take off a little strange as traveling backwards but when in cruise no problem at all. Several drinks services before and during meal service. Very relaxed and very professional crew. Food mackerel pate and steak quite good but not business class in its heyday which I was privileged to enjoy. The seat was strange. Very narrow and a lot of the time you are looking into a strangers face. BA has 8 across seating, more than any other business class operating the B777 in the World. Entertainment ok. Reasonable screen but hardly World Class. Things going fine until, 3 hours from touchdown they said that champagne was finished as they had to save enough for returning passengers. What about we passengers who had paid a lot of their own money to fly Club as a special treat. We persuaded a very nice first Class CA to raid first Class to provide a glass of champagne.

british-airways;D Lee;South Africa;2015-06-11;This is more of a general review having travelled almost exclusively with BA longhaul as a family for the past 3-4 years. I highly rate BA for families. On our travels I have found the BA staff inflight: 1) To be sympathetic towards my wife and I with having infants. They have offered quiet areas during service (on the A380) to help settle our baby. Left us to last for dinner service if we were in the middle of settling the kids (nothing worse that being made to take a tray of food when all you want is your kids to sleep). 2) Friendly and attentive, but maintaining professionalism. Crew are not servants to passengers. They have a fairly strict roster of duties to attend to but I find that they are more than happy to help at the less peak times. They are less inclined when they have 300 people to feed. It figures. I am fortunate to regularly travel longhaul for business and so reach Silver tier on an annual basis. Having BC check-in is a great bonus for checking in a family - shorter queue etc. The greatest perk is that as Silver I get 2 bags at 32kg each. Not only that but when I travel with my family, my wife and eldest child get the same allowance as I do and our infant gets 23kg bag. Plus car seats and pram free. That is a huge allowance and makes packing less stressful. BA are a professional outfit and get you where you are going, I have no issues with them and find them value for money.

british-airways;D Ross;United Kingdom;2015-06-11;"LHR to YVR return. Hard earned Avios points trip. Had been 3 years since I last travelled Club World and not much changed. The lounge at Heathrow was very crowded. Afternoon Tea time so just sandwiches, cakes and soup available. Sandwiches were fresh and very nice. Plane as a 747 that had seen better times. The seat was clean but tired looking. The biggest let down was the screen that was blurry in comparison to the Bling Airways screen I had in economy. The main meal was really nice. Beef fillet that was tender and cooked. Side Salad full of flavour and Mediterranean starter that I wanted more of. The 2nd meal was ""afternoon tea"" of 3 finger sandwiches and a piece of chocolate rocky road. A real cream tea would have been better! Seat comfortable upright and in sleeping position. Got plenty of rest and sleep both ways. Coming back the lounge in Vancouver is above the gate. Just enough seats. Nice snacks. Another nice meal on board, spoilt by a dry bread roll. Breakfast was a big disappointment. Expecting a cooked English breakfast we got fruit in a plastic box followed by an egg and bacon muffin. I took one bight of the muffin and it mad me want to gag. Good crews on both legs. Bags came out priority so big plus to BA. As a free plus taxes and surcharges trip it was good, but BA need to improve if they want to lead the pack instead of being just average.";Business Class;7.0;4.0;5.0;4.0;3.0;5.0;1

The seating is fine in this class and is definitely worth the extra from standard economy in terms of the leg room. However that's where it ends. The service compared with Business which I travelled out in, is woeful. The BA cabin staff seem to treat anybody not flying in Business or First as second-class citizens and barely do their job. That and the awful food - the worst I've had on a long haul flight has made me seriously re-think my choice of carrier next time I fly the route.;Premium Economy;3.0;4.0;1.0;1.0;3.0;3.0;0
british-airways;Kevin Barrance;United Kingdom;2015-06-11;This review concerns LHR-BOM in Business Class. I'm not a fan of the BA business class seating. It's very awkward to access the aisle from a window seat and also the practice of having your meals passed over a retractable divider is difficult for both the customer and the flight attendant. Having said all that, the service on board was great, the stewardess looking after my side of the cabin was chatty, friendly and couldn't do enough to help. The seat itself is OK, not overly comfortable but I did manage a few hours sleep. Food is not great on BA though. ;Business Class;7.0;2.0;5.0;2.0;3.0;3.0;1

Flights on-time out, 1 hour delay on return, reason late inbound aircraft (really useless excuse). On departure no knowledge of which gates would be used for this and many other flights so both main lounges by security in T5 hellishly overcrowded. Assume the remote lounges would have been empty. 747 tired with ancient entertainment system but quiet upper deck, 777 the same except crowded and busy on the only deck - although both did have new first class so some upgrading had occurred, just not all of it. Crew however excellent throughout in both directions so well done, particularly return leg which had considerable number of young children making for demanding work. Food both directions actually quite decent, continual drinks service for first half of flight e/w then help yourself in galley. Good value as we gained big discounts when booking a holiday package. Had I paid full fare would have been very disappointed though, doesn't near match up to the main opposition these days - too many seats in an inconvenient layout. I do wonder if BA have given up going for the business traveller in premium classes on some long haul routes now (as they have for short haul club) and now see the higher spending families as their revenue source - maybe that's why we got the antiques to fly in.;Business Class;8.0;4.0;5.0;5.0;2.0;5.0;1

When I tried to check online the system did not allow me to do online check-in. I called the BA contact center in the UK and was shocked with the response received. The person told me that there is a difference between confirmed booking and confirmed seating. Essentially BA wants to sell their seats at a premium. They arm twist the passengers and make lame excuses that although you have confirmed flight bookings it doesn't mean you can fly unless you get the seats allocation.

The plane was parked in a no-mans area and we were bussed to the plane. To my horror I had to climb through the stairs with my carry on bag! The width of the seat and the leg space is the smallest I saw in my 40 years of travel experience. It's a shame that that the airline is using this kind of carrier for a Transatlantic flight. The quality of food is one of the worst I have ever seen. I picked the non-veg chicken item the taste and content was hopeless. The container was marked for expiry as 28/11/16 07.53 an expiry after 18 months but marked for the hour and minute.

The flight was in fact delayed by an hour despite the information such as was provided given as ""ten minutes"". The aircraft appeared dated and not especially clean with crumbs on the seat and grease marks on the windows. The inflight shopping was made difficult as there were no inflight duty free magazines available in Club Class. Inflight entertainment system did not work.

HER is infamous as a relic of the 70s and BA have done nothing to improve that. Check-in was interminable despite a Club Europe desk. There was a fast track option for security but this was roped off for our flight. No lounge was offered even though there are lounges available and used by other airlines. Not surprisingly there was no priority boarding. Our seats 2D and 2E are the only decent seats in the new Club Europe. Service on board was adequate.

Then we couldn't access the entertainment for over 90 minutes at the start of the flight due to some technical problem and again later in the flight it went off for about 60 minutes presumably due to the same problem. Our first meal was served more or less straight away and it was OK typical airline fare but there was then over 7 hour wait for the next meal which was laughably called afternoon tea one piece of bread cut into quarters with chicken and a scone with cream and butter. Four hours after the main meal they ran out of snacks and when my husband went in search of something to eat they gave him two packs of nuts and said they were for the return journey! Don't they stock up before picking up the next passengers? Luckily my husband always carries chocolate bars with him as he is diabetic but heaven knows what might have happened had he needed food from the staff. Before half way two of the toilets went out of service so there were some queues.

There were a few niggles on the outbound flight. Sound cancelling headphones but the sound quality was poor even at maximum volume. The reading light worked but was inadequate (probably because it was too far away). The cabin temperature was a little erratic and there were queues for the four toilets in economy (it could have been a problem if we had been flying through prolonged turbulence). But as I said these were just niggles - I enjoyed the upgrade and the flight. The return was delayed and the APU unserviceable (not uncommon with a 747). We had to wait for a second air starter unit (if it requires twos order them in advance) and it got rather stuffy whilst waiting. The pilot kept us informed of what was happening. Once underway it was a good flight and I rested well. Cheerful and efficient crew in both directions. Food was good outbound and adequate inbound.

I was pleasantly surprised (for my friend) that he was able to check-in his big carry-on for free while I paid for check-in luggage. I understood why in the end. My biggest gripe has to be that the Sunday flight departs and arrives late into LHR. This was worsened by the fact that it was a full flight but the overhead bins were already full before all were on board hence there was a 20 minute delay on the tarmac as remaining hand-carry luggage had to be put in the hold. Unfortunately flight did not manage to catch up while in the air hence we landed 20 minutes late cutting it close to the curfew time for LHR. We had to run all the way through and almost missed the last Heathrow Express train. I will never fly a late flight into LHR again. That said the pilot and cabin crew were entertaining - quite chatty over the PA and with some passengers though not necessarily friendly to all customers. 2.5 hours on an A320 passed by without any in-flight entertainment (to be expected for regional flights) and with some food and refreshments (which were good).;Economy;7.0;4.0;4.0;4.0;1.0;4.0;1

british-airways;Michael Stanley;Australia;2015-05-31;BA 10 Bangkok to London Heathrow May 26th 2015 World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy). First the positives: check-in at BKK was reasonably efficient the flight departed on time and landed at LHR about 15 minutes early. Unfortunately while World Traveller Plus provides some extra leg room when compared to economy there was nothing else about our flight experience that justified the additional cost of World Traveller Plus. The cabin seating and equipment were tired - the entertainment system was old and barely functional. However by far the worst aspect of the flight was the poor service from the cabin crew who almost without exception appeared uninterested in customer service to the point of rudeness. Their strategy seemed to be to minimise their exposure to customers in order to maximise the time they could spend in the galley at the rear of the aircraft. After the first meal service (an uninspiring Chicken Curry with boiled to death broccoli and carrot not remotely resembling the misleadingly optimistic descriptions found on the BA website about the supposed 'enhanced' dining experience of World Traveller Plus) calls for service went unanswered for lengthy periods of time. It seemed the only effective way to obtain further service was to walk to the rear galley where staff congregated and made it clear they did not appreciate being 'interrupted' barely acknowledging requests while continuing their conversation and grudgingly fulfilling requests to a bare minimum. In stark contrast to the excellent cabin service food and entertainment options we experienced flying in economy on Qantas to Bangkok the previous day this so called 'premium' experience on BA was extremely disappointing.

We hung around Gate A area and waited for further advice and waited and waited. The clock ticked on and we all waited for the advice the board is supposed to display. Come 1920 (supposed to be boarding) and still no gate number or advice as to the delayed boarding.

Still no explanation as to why we were an hour late. We caught the transit service and headed over there finally boarding the plane after the rescheduled departure time. The air conditioning was virtually non-functional and we were forced to sit in the stinking heat waiting for some sort of explanation and apology. The staff seemed surly and disinterested in our discomfort and one stewardess near us at the rear of the plane refused two requests from passengers to bring water using the defence that she was ""on my own back here and cannot leave my post"". Incredibly she left her post several times when it suited her to talk to other stewards etc! About 2110 the Captain announced that they had ""lost a passenger and we should depart within 10-15 minutes"".

british-airways;A Stevenson;United Kingdom;2015-05-31;"Punta Cana - Gatwick. World Traveller Plus cabin on B777. I find this particular cabin very noisy possibly due to proximity of the engines. Seats are comfortable and leg room and elbow room significantly better than economy. The front row of World Traveller Pus has even more legroom but be warned that this is a mixed blessing since this row is fitted with shelves for strapping down babies cradles and if you sit next to a passenger who requires this facility then it will severely compromise your space. IFE was OK but nothing special. Main meal was OK but breakfast was an absolute disgrace; a dry cheese croissant and a small granola bar. No alternatives offered. I know this is not business class but for the premium I paid for World Traveller Plus I feel entitled to something better than this really very poor take it or leave it excuse for a breakfast. The drinks service was nothing special either; one round of juice or water before take off an offer of wine with dinner and another juice and water run after dinner. Then nothing until breakfast. Regarding the crew some were engaging and friendly but far too many others were offhand and unsmiling. When in all innocence I used a toilet in the Business Class cabin I found a member of cabin crew waiting for me when I emerged who promptly berated me for my mistake. Fair enough but when I explained that other passengers in World Traveller Plus had also used the toilets in Business Class I was virtually called a liar. I backed off from an argument but I found the experience upsetting and I simply couldn't get to sleep thereafter. I eventually disembarked at LGW hungry thirsty and a somewhat unhappy bunny.

The Club World cabin is definitely cramped compared with other business class cabins and I do not know what BA were thinking when they decided to pack in so many seats and in such a way as to make it very awkward for less mobile passengers to exit their seats. Storage space is lacking around the seats due to BA trying to fit too many passengers into too small a space. I would not say I would not travel Club World with BA again but would look at alternative airlines with different cabin layouts first.;Business Class;7.0;4.0;4.0;4.0;3.0;4.0;1

Especially loved the stylish and comfortable interiors of the refitted A319 on the Naples run. Both flights left late but it didn't seem to seriously affect arrival time. Only complaint is the food/drinks service sandwich is not to my taste and I now refuse them - but other passengers seem pleased.

Slept just as well in business class engine noise seemed greater in first class and screaming baby did not help either.

british-airways;P Alderson;United Kingdom;2015-05-27;LHR-SEA World Traveler Plus. As a BA Executive Club member I was able to use the Club bag drop where there was no queue. The Fast Track security staff were disorganised and patronising. The Gold/First lounge was busy and at times uncomfortably hot. Boarding from the C Gates was well organised. On taking my seat I was offered a water or orange juice. The 777-300 has the newish seats that were quite comfortable except for the headrest which does not have adjustable wings. The situation was helped by the fact that I had been able to select an emergency exit row aisle seat (22B). Departure was on time. Bar service was just before and with the meal. I had used the facility available on this route to pre-order my main course. Overall the meal was quite good. The Mixed Fleet staff commendably avoided the bizarre practice on some other carriers of closing the window blinds after the meal service. The seat was a bit stiff in adjusting to a recline. The leg support cushions were useless as they did not move far enough to make contact with my legs. Time passed quickly as the entertainment system was very good. A reasonable snack of sandwiches and a scone was served about an hour before landing. We arrived a the gate slightly ahead of schedule. Immigration bag collection and customs were completed in under half an hour.;Premium Economy;8.0;3.0;4.0;4.0;5.0;4.0;1

These flights were on BA's newly configured A320's we paid for Emergency Exit row seats on both ways and very thankful that we did British Airways have reduced the legroom in both Economy & Business class to 30"" and at 6'1 the normal legroom now is quite tight. The seats themselves are quite comfortable and having storage at the top of the seats mean you don't lose your legroom. The service on board was excellent friendly staff both ways provided with a wrap roll cheese and biscuits and a chocolate mousse both ways return not as nice as outbound and they offer complimentary drinks. Looking at business class all you get is the middle seat free and no extra legroom a lounge and a hot meal so wouldn't think it's worth the upgrade fee anymore (having travelled many times in club with BA new product is not a winner from what I could see).

british-airways;W Coenik;Australia;2015-05-20;Business class. Scheduled to fly from Rome to Gatwick on 7 May on BA2543. The day that the fire broke out at Rome airport. We had a 12.45pm flight. I received a text from BA at 6.30am advising of flight cancelled due to the fire and to contact BA. I called them and they rebooked us on flight BA555 at 8.15pm but direct to Heathrow. We accepted the flight change considering and lounged around Rome for the morning. Than when about to get the train to Rome airport received a text from BA advise that flight had been changed to Naples and if we wanted that flight to make our way to Naples. So we high tailed it onto a train and in 2 hours we were in Naples. The flight did not leave till 9.30pm as they were waiting on others who had made the trip to Naples and out of 152 seats on the plane about 130 people made the trip to Naples. I think the communication and the effect that BA did to get us out of Rome under the circumstances was excellent. A friend was flying to Paris from Rome on another airline and he was delayed till midnight and his luggage was not to accompany them and was delivered 2 days later to him. Once on board in Euro Business class it was all pamper. The meal was excellent of rockmelon with truffle infused coleslaw and BBQ style prawns. Finished with a rhubarb and custard desert and washed down with a lovely Spanish white. Once landed bags were quick out on the belt and away we went.

Upgraded service - welcome drink newspaper hot towel menu noise cancelling headphones upgraded blanket and much better food than economy (steak) bread selection etc. One flight attendant for the whole cabin but he was super efficient. Flight Attendant was excellent - friendly professional with none of the BA attitude that some have. Toilet just for premium economy. Negatives: 747 aircraft is old and you can feel that. Inflight entertainment is ancient small screen limited selection in both video and music Seat space and functionality good but not Air NZ.

british-airways;Kathleen Lee;Switzerland;2015-05-20;Our flight on economy long distance from the Austin to Heathrow was the most uncomfortable we've had on any carrier and we have travelled extensively. The seats were so close together with hardly any leg room or arm movement that not only was it difficult to eat the food which was dreadful but very difficult to get in and out of without damaging or twisting a knee or back. We had extreme exhaustion on landing from discomfort and lack of sleep. The evening meal we were served was inedible. The pasta had been hanging around for some time by the appearance. It was dry and congealing in what was once tomato sauce. The foil container was bent and the foil cover crumpled which proves it had been handled and heated up frequently. As for the breakfast in a box it was so bad I cannot comment. We've had better food and seating on low budget airlines and as well as on Myanmar Airlines! We want to support our national airline but definitely not on BA economy. It seems all the attention and care is given to first and business class.

The flight taxied and took off with passengers sleeping with their seats flat in the centre ""couples seat"". The crew was totally indifferent. The light meal post take off was offered only to passengers in the aisle seats for reasons best known to the crew. If you are seated in the centre ""couple seats"" you have to be either an acrobat or a gymnast to access the toilets as you have to jump over a sleeping passenger in the aisle to get there. The buggy requested to transport us to the lounge at Heathrow as my wife had just had surgery showed up but the lady driving it decided we did not need it and walked off as a result we had to trek for 2 hrs to clear security and reach the lounge.

Easy check in at the Club World desk and then quickly through security etc. Unusually for BA at Gatwick boarding was very well organised and we were quickly on board the ageing 777 - 200. Water or orange was offered prior to take off along with a hot towel. We pushed back from the stand at exactly our departure time and were airborne about 10 minutes later. I can't say the seats were the most comfortable I have ever sat on but the extra leg room in PE did help. Two drinks rounds were served one before and one with lunch. The food was just about OK although I never have any great expectations so I am rarely disappointed. However the size and picture quality of the TV screens was very poor and as a result I decided to read for most of the journey. The cabin crew overall were very professional and as a result we had a good flight. The return flight was pretty much the same although despite being being bronze exec card holders we were refused permission to check in at the Club World desk which as it turned out didn't make any difference.

Although having a seat on the plane only a few row down from the front some meal selections had run out. The cabin staff hid behind curtains most of the flight therefore service was at a minimum.

An excellent experience: as always the cabin crew make the difference. On all sectors professional well-turned-out staff who were genuinely friendly cheerful and helpful. Food was excellent (chicken or pasta seem to be a thing of the past - I was not offered either) nicely presented and for me in sufficient quantity. Water/orange juice runs on a regular basis washrooms clean and tidy and well-stocked A wide range of entertainment on the KWI-LHR sector (it kept me entertained for a 6-hour flight and because I flew out in April and back in May the selection had changed on the return flight). Smooth flights (the 747's on the KWI-LHR sector although old were well- maintained and everything worked - I really enjoy flying the ""Queen of the Skies"") and plenty of information from the flight deck. Slight delay outbound at Kuwait because of a technical problem but it was resolved: all other sectors were on time. I travelled on a Sunday in both directions so no delays in connections at Heathrow although I had built in sufficient time between flights to allow for delays when I booked my ticket. All in all four excellent flights - BA seem to have improved immensely since I last flew with them in 2014: the cabin crew and check-in staff seem to make the difference and for this reason I use BA in preference to the carriers from the Middle East especially as Terminal 5 at Heathrow is a very civilised place to transfer (at least in my experience).";Premium Economy;10.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;1

Another chance to try the A380 product and all seemed well online check in bag drop sensible loading on the air bridge at LAX but once we boarded a self important flight attendant decided she had to check the boarding passes to ensure we were on the right plane on the right day. No you do not we have been checked all the way along. Still even this pitiful attitude could not dampen the sterling job done by the pair of flight attendants we had. They gave Mixed Fleet a very good name. Now having got through everything needed on that trip we had the return. WTP so the food was OK the thing is during the trip the LAX sector had reverted back to the legacy staff. Disaster. The staff tried until around half way through the flight when a woman who spoke with a brogue I guess Eire arrived to take charge and declared the bar closed. So too were snacks of crisps etc. Half way through a long flight? BA claim the bar service and snacks are available throughout the flight. Clearly they are telling lies. This poor creature shut things because she had counted everything. Anyway if BA wish to lie to us we will not be buying from their High Life Shop. It cuts both ways. So to sum up most BA staff really do try to make passengers (the customers) enjoy the experience; certainly I have always flown BA where possible however when one employee on each sector can colour the experience in such a negative manner I shall not be rushing to fly them again.

I paid for seating selection weeks before. The day before on-line check-in opened I saw that some seats on the front of the plane became available to economy travellers with no surcharge so I took one of them to deplane as quick as possible (the plane landed a little bit ahead of schedule anyway). LHR-LAX on the A380 was a really nice experience really smooth flight and incredibly quiet upper-deck cabin. Food was not bad as long as you don't expect anything too fancy in economy. There was only one complete meal after take off and a pre- arrival snack before landing. On an 11 hours flight this may seem not enough but passengers are welcome to pick up snacks in the galley during the flight as well as having drinks fixed on demand. Only one negative spot of the flight: the cabin was really cold! SFO-LHR still on the A380 departed a little bit late due to a malfunction of one of the doors but crew kept us informed of the situation. Same nice experience nice crew and so on. LHR-BRU on an A320 departed late after being stuck on tarmac due to high departure rate at Heathrow. Once again the captain kept us informed and managed to catch most of the delay before landing in Brussels. Overall really nice experience but I wish they would not charge as much for seating selection before online check in. As I may be a nervous flyer I need a window seat and don't want to risk seating elsewhere. The four legs cost me more than 130 euros on pre-paid seating which I could take into account when choosing between BA and an another airline that let you choose free of charge when booking your flight.

Had to hike across in hot sun (which made me wish I wasn't going home). This is very annoying - because the whole point over flying BA instead of the three bright white blue and yellow planes of the Irish airline's planes parked next door - is convenience. This has in the past but did not this time include the use of an air-bridge. (More BA cuts I wonder) Plane was a newish A319 - and pushed back to the minute - and left bang on time. All clean and tidy including the wash-rooms. Seats rather old and worn - but we were comfortable in seats 1 a and 1 c. Afternoon tea served on board - nothing exceptional (not a lot one can do with this sort of meal) - but as my wife was driving when we landed I happily drank three Gin and T's.

The cabin felt spacious and comfortable even in economy. There was a good range of inflight entertainment and all staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

The A319 flight left from Heathrow Terminal 1 which is closing in June but now looks and feels like a ghost town. There were 3 shops open on the day of our departure and most of it is boarded up. As for the flight we had the usual BA chaotic boarding process but overall an excellent flight even if the new seats are uncomfortable and certainly similar to Ryanair with hardly any space.

They should follow the same process when flights land at a remote stand and have a separate bus just for use by Club Europe passengers at least when departing Club Europe passengers would enjoy their priority boarding.

I've recorded this repeatedly. Departure was delayed 45 minutes. Not the end of the world but an inconvenience which happens so regularly I can pretty much count on it. It's a shame BA can't address these issues and get flights operating to schedule the majority of the time as other airlines are well able to. Once on board BA is like a tale of two airlines. Some crews are excellent others just lack professionalism and behave rather strangely at times. Possibly this may stem from the two tier or mixed fleet system. But whatever the issue may be crew quality and service is inconsistent. When we landed at Newcastle a crew member announced that the flight was only 30 minutes behind schedule!

IFE was fine although not as good as CX. I was sitting in window seat facing backwards which was fine. The seat while sitting is comfortable enough although quite narrow. There is little storage and it can be awkward getting in and out of the seat especially when you are on the window. The problem was when the seat was in flat-bed mode. It is so narrow that you cannot turn. The seat buckles in the middle. As well the passenger next to me would slam his table and TV monitor shut throughout the flight and because of the design the seat you feel every movement. To get comfortable I had to put the seat in more of a recline mode in order to sleep which defeats the whole purpose of a flat bed. As well a fold down footstool completes the end of the bed and it wasn't stable. BA are charging a premium for this seat and they squeeze 8 across (compared to 4 for CX). They are making a great deal out of this amount of real estate in the air. It is time for them to deliver an update. The only reason I took this fare was because of the great luggage offering (which I needed on this occasion - 96 kg) and the fact that I was flying back in First for no additional cost which I will post about separately. So while I recommend this airline overall it is more because the service and staff did compensate. Next time I fly business it will be CX again.

One of the features of a British Airways (BA) flight that attracted me in the past was the breadth of special-meal options. This until recently included a ""seafood meal"". Indeed ten years ago BA had fisherman's pie as an option in economy class not just the horrible and relentless chicken-or-pasta - then they boasted of their support for the British fishing industry - no longer. Seafood meals are gone. Why? From a BA response: ""I'd like to inform you that the meals have been removed due to the low volumes with many of our customers now choosing other options"". Indeed. If no seafood meal exists then there is no choice there are no options. There is only chicken-or-pasta. Really what would it take to offer a ""cold seafood meal"" a tuna-fish salad and a bread roll?

Cabin on both planes was clean staff mostly attentive (Hong Kong leg to Heathrow staff were worst of the 4 legs - ok but didn't seem overly interested in going the extra mile). As a taller person I appreciated the additional legroom and recline although when passenger in front reclined it is tricky to get out of your seat. I had veggie meals which were generally tasty and as usual served prior to everyone else - i did have to remind staff on the last leg to offer me a drink when they served everyone else's meal.

british-airways;K Jona;United Kingdom;2015-04-19;My experience on return BA flights to LHR to Tokyo Narita in April 2015 scores very low. I used to fly on Virgin Atlantic for the same journey on Business Class for the past 10 years so I have something to compare and the fare is always more or less the same between those 2 airlines. Conclusion is that you get far better value and service for money for the Business Class on Virgin was my impression. BA T5 lounge is very photogenic but the reality is quite 'basic' and cheap decor. Selection of food and beverages is limited. In the end I got fed up so I left the lounge to get better food from Wetherspoons! Since I'm small both airlines seats are fine to get a good sleep. On BA you'd still have to pay to select your seat despite paying thousands of pounds! Also if you are in the middle aisle on BA you are right next to a stranger which is awkward. BA gives out Elemis kits. Food: on BA there is a 'fixed' options. For the dessert you have to choose either 'cake' or 'cheese'. Not both. Also not too different a menu from Economy class. BA's service felt extremely limited they don't know your names they just do the very minimum service. BA disappointed me.;Business Class;2.0;4.0;1.0;2.0;2.0;1.0;0
british-airways;R Vines;United Kingdom;2015-04-19;My return flight from Heathrow to Bologna last week reminded me of how good BA is for short haul in economy. Even a two-hour delay because of technical problems on the outgoing flight did nothing to change that view. The pilot kept us up to date on what was happening. The crew were charming. OK the snack of a sandwich on such flights is pretty basic but the whole experience is so much more civilized than on budget airlines.;Economy;7.0;3.0;4.0;3.0;1.0;4.0;1

british-airways;G Scholes;United Kingdom;2015-04-17;DEL-LHR BA 256. Seats 17AB downstairs in business class in B747-400 G-BNLY. The aircraft is an old lady now but the interior is well maintained. Her age was most noticeable looking at the in-flight screen. I have become used to the clarity of modern screens and the faded dim and blurred old fashioned moving map and flight information screens are a relic of a distant past. I have made several long haul flights with BA in Business Class recently and have decided that I don't like the standard BA model business class seat. There is nowhere to put small items like glasses pens landing cards and so on. There is a drawer at floor level suitable for shoes and other items you will not want during the flight but to access it you need an upright seat and have to sit well forward to lean down to it. There is no foot rest integrated into the seat one you can adjust to your own preferred level. At the front of the seat pod is a flap then can be lowered by getting out of the seat. It is not strong and so can not be used as a seat and is not an ottoman. Clunky and peculiar to BA it is not a design feature that enhances the seat. Individual seats feel narrow and the window seat pod facing aft is accessed through a narrow entrance leading into a snug and very private space. Thoughts about coffins come to mind. When the passenger in the row behind has their seat flat their feet cross the entrance to yours and have to be stepped over to exit. Seat 17B was a poor choice. It is just aft of a set of catering cupboards that are frequently accessed during meal service and a washroom that seems to be in use almost continuously with queues stretching past the seat after meals and before landing. On the good side the seats are well contoured and comfortably padded.;Business Class;6.0;3.0;4.0;4.0;2.0;3.0;1

The food was ""tea"" there was no entertainment system and the only difference I could find from premium coach or regular coach was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. As alcoholic beverages are provided for all classes there's nothing to be gained there the seat pitch was pathetic and aside from having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had was boarding and de-planing first.

british-airways;J McDonald;United Kingdom;2015-04-17;Flew BA256 from Delhi to Heathrow - usual BA issues which have been repeated here many times. Firstly the First cabin was not clean (at all) with debris on the floor food still in the seat - it's pretty pathetic when you have to spend 5 minutes cleaning your area when you board! The food - the food can only be described as truly awful! To be honest I would be complaining if I received this standard of food in economy - the starter was a watery oily leek and potato soup and for the main two small lamb chops overdone in gravy with 6 tiny potatoes that deflated when pierced with a fork. I did not bother with desert! Afternoon tea served up (probably) the worst patisserie I have ever had the displeasure of tasting - completely inedible. The cabin crew were good and pleasant however I was not offered any bottled water for a 10 hour flight. It would seem to me that BA are a budget airline trying to do luxury and failing horribly. Surely management cannot be happy with their current standards but I am struggling to see any level of improvement (I take at least 1 first class international flight every year). Have flown BA for 15 years will now be trying other airlines. The lounge (not run by BA but used by BA) at Delhi was very good indeed.;First Class;4.0;3.0;3.0;1.0;3.0;2.0;0

Food quality was good not excellent but the film choice was great. Flat bed seats were comfortable enough. The breakfast was a little skimpy. The major downside was that for the money you pay for business class you should not have to pay to choose a seat at booking. BA will let you choose seats 7 days in advance if you are a mileage plan 1st elevated tier or better member but if not then you have to wait until 24 hours ahead. Of course you can always fork over another $113 to pre-reserve a seat. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.;Business Class;7.0;3.0;3.0;3.0;5.0;3.0;1
british-airways;Lynn Ryder;United Kingdom;2015-04-16;We flew for the very first time on BA on 27/03/15 and returned 06/03/15. Our holiday to St Lucia from Gatwick was booked through Kuoni and we usually fly with Virgin Atlantic. We always upgrade with Virgin to Premium Economy as you have a larger luggage allowance and the Premium Economy Experience with Virgin is very good. Therefore we booked BA World Traveller Plus expecting the same degree of service. What a disappointment! I would not advise wasting your upgrade money. Apart from getting the larger luggage allowance BA World Traveller Plus is almost exactly the same as World Traveller. The Service both ways was appalling! The seats were old and shabby and uncomfortable we were only offered bar service once on a 8/9 Hour flight! We had to drink from plastic beakers the staff seemed preoccupied with Business Class Customers and had no time for our section at all. On the way back my Husband and myself were given seats 2 rows apart at check in without being told. We only noticed when we boarded the aircraft. On this length of flight I was most upset we were apart as everyone sat near me were single travellers and Were asleep throughout the 9 hours. The seat back TVs are very small and my TV didn't work properly and I couldn't even watch anything. The aircraft was badly in need of an interior upgrade.

I travel a lot for work and always try to fly BA whenever possible and so am lucky enough to have a Gold card So for our annual vacation I was looking forward to hopefully getting us all (wife plus 9 year old daughter) into the First Class lounge at LHR as a nice start to our holidays sadly the staff member on the door said no. - yes I know you can only normally sign in 1 guest but for my other 50+ flights a year I never sign in anyone! Still no joy-computer said no. So I asked the guy behind me if he would mind signing my wife into the lounge at which pointthe staff member told him quite aggressively 'that is not protocol'. We walked away having been made to feel like naughty kids. Rest of the trip was fine-In fact I would go as far as to say the flight was excellent-really friendly cabin crew who made us feel welcome and gave us a good start to the holidays. Actually I would say this was BA at its best (having just seen them at their worst!).

Delayed departure from LHR on a very full 777-200. Food and wine good but the Club World cabin is very cramped with very little space to put anything. I don't mind the back and front seating (I could look at my wife!) but the seat is narrow and not the most comfortable for sleeping. Very good attentive crew. Wide variety of films/music on IFE. On return the third party Lounge (Club at ATL) is much better than the Delta one. Full flight very similar to outbound but slightly early arrival at LHR was negated by the domestic flight being delayed by 90 minutes due to runway problems.;Business Class;7.0;2.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;4.0;1

british-airways;M Clay;United Kingdom;2015-04-14;While I booked with BA I at first did not realise that they were putting me on a Vueling Airline but flying under a BA number. Quite clearly this airline is at the bottom of the bucket airlines in both service and comfort. As we were flying back from Barcelona to the UK having my knees wedged up against the seat in front only lasted a couple of hours. The food service which you had to pay for was indifferent and very expensive. If you sat in the middle of the plane you just didn't get served. Probably the most worrying thing besides the extremely poor English by cabin and flight crew was the cabin staff apparent indifference to seats being up right for landing preventing some passengers taking their over head luggage down while in the air and on landing passengers up and around while the aircraft was moving. Perhaps UK bucket airlines are not so bad.;Economy;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;0
british-airways;J Rose;Australia;2015-04-14;BA 208 MIA-LHR in Club. Leg four of a seven leg BA adventure. Another disappointment which is becoming commonplace. As in leg one BKK-LHR my pre-assigned business class seat that I had selected months before departure mysteriously vanished at the gate. In the end BA needed the seat for a family to be seated together. All well and good mind you but to have the audacity to charge passengers for these seats and give them away is absolutely disgraceful. As such my quiet no traffic window seat on the upper deck was quickly relegated to a high traffic aisle seat on the main deck right near the lavatory and galley ensuring no sleep on the overnight flight. As a loyal OneWorld Emerald passenger I can honestly say BA really don't care about us in this (or any) regard. The CSD was sympathetic and kind but nobody else seemed to care one bit. That hasn't happened to me on any other carrier for years and has happened twice in the past few weeks on BA. Moral of the story: Never ever pay BA for a pre-assigned seat as there is simply no guarantee you will get what you pay for. Moral of the story part 2: fly another carrier if you can as it can't be much worse than BA.;Business Class;1.0;1.0;3.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;0

World traveller plus was very good with fab leg room and comfy seats. Nice food too. Managed to sleep 5 hours in quiet cabin. But if I had paid normal price then it was not worth the extra money as we found economy seats on the flight home were very comfy and good leg room.

Flight out was an hour or so late taking off because of the weather but was excellent once we got going. Fairly creaky 747 but the IFE was fine (good film selection) and the free booze flowed throughout. Great curry on the food front. Return was the real highlight on a new A380 that had joined the fleet four weeks ago. Large TVs even bigger selection of films/TV shows/games and the usual good free food (shepherd's pie) and drink (red wine and beer). Comfy seats with plenty of leg room (and I'm over six foot).

british-airways;A Bouzid;United Kingdom;2015-04-10;Flew 30th March 2015 LHR-YVR return with my school on a rugby tour (27 people). Seats were reasonably comfortable and they catered to my food requests of no pork well. Enjoyed it. But the IFE was absolutely horrendous and did not meet my expectations of British Airways- outdated movies with TV shows from 3 months before. Since we were flying on a Boeing 747-400 there were more seats per aisle but this made the cabin feel quite cramped. One recommendation for them - put fewer seats per aisle! Even though there were negatives flying outbound I have to say the return was great. I had swapped seats with another boy who wanted to sit next to someone so I sat in the extra legroom seats. IFE was far better and due to having the window seat I was able to sleep for around 6 hours when I was awoke by the breakfast/snack which was decent. Food had no flavour and was quite spicy (Lentil masala) but still edible. Although my experience on BA84 was very enjoyable I heard many of my companions had to move seats because of the not working IFE. One of my coaches had ordered orange juice so the cabin crew gave it to him as they were serving but then the other one would take it away for some reason and in the end they said they had none left. He had flown with Cathay Pacific to Manila the preceding week and he said that he had enjoyed that thoroughly. One of his worst experiences of air travel especially due to him being 6'4 and rather large. Overall a decent experience but just met my expectations. To improve British Airways need to start to be able to compete with other airlines like Singapore Emirates Etihad Cathay Pacific and Qantas as there service and level of comfort has definitely taken over from BA.;Economy;7.0;4.0;4.0;4.0;2.0;3.0;1

Both seats had seen better days the covers of which were in places falling apart. Food was only average too in my opinion.

On the flight to London FAs were not unpleasant but not overly active except for the required meal service and duty free sales. However additional drinks were handed out in the galley if requested. On the flight back a rather young crew was trying harder but was - quite untypically for BA - rather robotic in their actions and announcements. Again additional drinks were served if requested. Both legs featured the new slim seats in the cabin with reduced legroom. I am really missing the older more comfortable BA seats. Flying with hand baggage only we used web check-in for the first flight and the check in kiosk for the flight back. Both worked efficiently. Boarding procedures were unremarkable and pleasant. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE which again was quite busy but not overcrowded. The Lounge as such is acceptable but far from great with limited and lower quality offerings. Food and drink seem to be more or less the same in all lounges in VIE including OS flagship lounge. BA’s Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 again a comfortable oasis of rest amid a busy airport. However this time (breakfast time) the food offerings were quite basic and drink wise even basics such as orange juice or tomato juice were not available. Hopefully just an off day. BA still uses T3 for its flights to VIE which I consider a huge benefit over using T5 which looks nice but tends to be a mess for passengers. Overall a good flight experience although I have had much better crews on BA before. Still consider BA as one of the best options for Economy flights in Europe.

The only excuse was ""it's the rules"" (obviously BA). Staff in addition took calls whilst handling my - urgent - request further delaying the process. If I have a choice I will definitely use other airlines. In addition they have changed the seating in Europe to come more in line with Easyjet and Ryanair. At 6""4 very uncomfortable.

Sold feeling a little let down secured seats 1a and 2a on the 744 these are the best of a bad bunch as to I wonder why BA squeezes 14 seats into such a small area where other airlines only fit 8 seats into the front sections of 744s'. At the beginning of March I checked the booking online only to find that we had been moved to row 5 in the middle this was not acceptable. I called the BA gold line to object only to be given numerous contradicting excuses non of which were valid whilst on the flight I found out that the passenger in 1a was a lifetime gold member so. I can only assume that rank has its privileges. Now onto the flight arrogant staff with one exception really poor food served at different times as we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to us. Plane interior shabby not surprised for a 20 plus year old plane along with the PA being inaudible I felt this to be a safety issue and when mentioned I was ignored. I booked this flight for us a part of a special Far East holiday I had high expectations of BA First which have not been met in anyway what a total waste of money. Will now try to avoid flying BA in any of there classes once I have redeemed my Avios balance.;First Class;1.0;3.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;0

BA really should consider cutting back the number of seats and sell a truly premium product like so many others have now chosen to do. Food disappointing as usual - much room for improvement here. Decent wines but whites/champagne always warm on the return as kept unchilled during the turnaround. T5 experience fine both ways as mid-week and time of year not so busy.

british-airways;Chris Matthews;United Kingdom;2015-03-28;This was the last flight in a One World around the world ticket. Buenos Aries to LHR a 13 hour flight. I really didn't have any complaints about this flight or BA but against the other 7 airlines in 3 months it was pretty average. The FA's were helpful the food was OK the only really bad thing was the AVOD. Half a dozen new releases and a dozen or so older films. Likewise the album selection- pretty poor. The 777 was around 6 years old so maybe was due for an upgrade. To be fare I'm comparing BA against Emirates so no contest really!;Economy;7.0;4.0;4.0;4.0;2.0;4.0;1
british-airways;W Harris;United Kingdom;2015-03-28;London Gatwick (LGW) to Lanzarote (ACE). We haven't flown BA for sometime and to be honest we have no desire to fly with BA again anytime soon. The plane was an Airbus 320 and was just like a bus. Uncomfortable hard very upright seats not even sure you can recline them. We sat in row 11 and on both outward and inbound flights the cabin temperature was far to hot and stuffy although it seemed to be an issue in just 4 rows as the front and back of the plane was much cooler. We both came off the return flight with bad headaches. The food was simply awful thank goodness we ate a proper breakfast before boarding as the minuscule roll and wrap was hardly enough to feed a child and on that topic the food was not suitable for a young toddler and there was no child option. The service was ok nothing to complain about very matter of fact and despite the previous comments the plane was clean etc. We flew the same route in October last year with a UK holiday airline and that was all round far more superior.;Economy;5.0;1.0;2.0;1.0;1.0;2.0;0
british-airways;K Rahman;India;2015-03-26;DEL-LHR-HAM in Business. The club world product feels really old now. The seats are narrow and not up to the standards of a world class airline. It was innovative when it came out but now feels narrow dated and not a match even to Air India which has modern flat seats on the Dreamliner. The food was OK but nothing special. The service was also ok but lacked touches like smiles hot towels. Amenity kits very cheap. The young Indian crew members on the Delhi route noticeably better than the older London based British crew. The plane was an old and slightly grubby 747. Basically everything was mediocre if adequate. The overall impression was a product past it's prime from the 1990s. Old planes old crew old seats old IFE BA are losing ground not just to Emirates but also other European carriers like LH or AF. It feels like the 1970s and 1980s before BA transformed itself.;Business Class;5.0;2.0;3.0;3.0;2.0;4.0;0

Staff were helpful and polite - in fact they couldn't do enough for me. Seats were comfortable. Entertainment was OK and food was satisfactory. My only criticism is that on the outbound flight we were served lunch immediately on taking off but then had to wait neatly 7 hours for a light snack before landing. As I did not want to 'raid the larder' and eat fattening foods I was left starving!

The upper deck was excellent as it was very quiet and private with approx 20 seats in the forward section. Entertainment very good on a larger screen than found on 747/777.

Sandwich out and a choice of snacks (crisps biscuits or chocolate raisins) in as well as complementary drinks including alcohol. Smooth through Geneva airport in and out; stuck in a 40-minute passport queue at LGW on the way in (not BA's fault of course) followed by a long walk around renovation work for the airport shuttle to the train station. This was a rare occasion where BA was cheaper than all of the competition on the route. On balance I just don't think the BA experience is much better than the low-cost competition unless you fly to Heathrow where Terminal 5 is much nicer than Gatwick. Although the food and drink is free the choice is quite limited (e.g. no British beer no option to buy something substantial if you're hungry and the snack was a bit stingy on the way back). I thought we might get newspapers but we didn't. On balance it was perfectly fine but I wouldn't pay the extra for BA - I'd actually rather have the choice friendliness and flexibility you get with easyJet.";Economy;7.0;4.0;4.0;3.0;2.0;4.0;1

To begin with when I reached Mumbai airport with our online check in printouts 4 hours before scheduled departure I was pleasantly surprised to see the BA staff ready to check in the baggage. We were thru checked in up to Chicago with a 5 hour halt at LHR. London Heathrow Terminal 5 is chaotic to say the least the security taking forever (in our case 45 min) to clear the hand baggage gave us some 3 hours before we boarded our Chicago flight which was comfortable. Our next connection from Chicago to SFO on AA was a bit messy as the cabin space was full and last minute check-in of hand baggage was enforced. Then for our SFO-LHR-DEL flight the SFO-LHR got delayed but again check-in was pleasant and though the connection time between two flights was 80 minutes because of the delay we had a margin of only 35 minutes. When we requested the flight purser to let us disembark before anyone else he said ""why did you take this connection even if you make it somehow your baggage wont"" - so much for assistance! Even after disembarking last of all we were met by the BA representative at the gate who took us thru the fast track channel and we made it to the flight in a record 20 minutes.

Breakfast on arrival in London was poor too. IFE is horrendously behind competitors. Really dire. Ran out of options after about half an hour. Some airlines offer thousands of films and programmes.

My main problem was that by the time they got to me for each meal time whatever I had chosen off the menu they had run out of or there had been a mistake and they didn't have the meals that were on the menu. Often I would have to call out to them for a drink as they seemed to forget that there was another seat.

Drinks were offered occasionally - 3/4 times on a ten hour flight - slightly warm coffee - ran out of ice. The idea that you have a selection of food to choose from in the business class galley was a joke. Non business class passengers used business class toilet and then helped themselves to the food. Inflight entertainment very poor.

british-airways;J Bryant;United Kingdom;2015-03-18;"I have to admit to not being a fan of the BA Club World (Business Class) configuration but this is what our travel agent came up with for our direct flight. Seating you head to toe allows them to get in 8 seats across compared to their competitors normal 7. On my flight 11 rows this gave them 11 extra seats good for the bean counters but can cause problems for the passengers. On my flight from MLE to LGW 10 hrs 35 minutes I was in 11B facing forward and in the bed position my feet were on a drop down stool fixed to the back of 10B. The passenger in 10A facing back had to step over my legs to exit their seat and kicked me a number of times as they did this during the long flight. It is illegal to drink alcohol in the airport in Male and so after take off I was looking forward to a cold lager. The drinks trolley came but all the beer including the lager was warm. The FA said that they had no means of cooling the lager on board. I cannot drink warm lager and I am not a spirit drinker and so went without. I settled down to watch a film but my entertainment system would work for about 15 minutes and then shut itself down. No entertainment system and I then found that some of the adjustment buttons on the seat did not appear to be working so it was either sitting up or lying down and risk being kicked. There were 2 meal services on the flight. The first one was OK but when it came to the second one when they got to me last row in the cabin they had run out of food and all they could offer me was a salad.

This meant we had to change terminals T5 to T3 with very little time following our flight from Manchester - even with the priority transfer notes it was a very close call and very stressful - not helped by the fact that we got held up trying to leave T5 due to a closed door! The flight with AA was OK but the food on both the outward and return legs was disgusting and not at all what we expected. The BA web site allowed me to book the arrival transfer but refused to allow me to book the return so I had to organise that myself!

british-airways;C Patterson;United Kingdom;2015-03-04;We flew with BA on 6th February to Goa - had three flights in all starting at Manchester. On our outbound journey we were upgraded to Premium Economy which was fantastic! Very comfortable food was much nicer. On our way back we were in economy. As a family of 4 we were split only by an aisle but it is much nicer to all sit together. Our youngest was awfully sick I think as a result of turbulence as well as sleep deprivation. Bless the steward who cleaned it up. However we were sat for 10 hours with the after effects! Nothing anyone could have done however. Staff always very friendly and nothing seems to be any trouble. Would certainly fly again with them but this next time the prices have rocketed. Not as much room in the economy and when seats are reclined there's little room. The passenger in front kept putting her hands over the back of her head rest which then covered my TV screen - I had to keep moving them off. Just one bit of advice for the stewards - make sure during meal times you are vigilant in ensuring that passengers put their seats up!;Economy;7.0;3.0;4.0;4.0;5.0;4.0;1

I used AVIOS points for these flights and had booked in World Traveller Plus. From the moment I boarded at LHR terminal 5. I was addressed by name throughout the flight. (I have a BA Executive Club Silver Card.) The cabin crew couldn't have been more friendly yet discreet. Offered a glass of champagne extra wine and post dinner drinks. I was given a very warm welcome. On the return from JFK I was surprised and pleased to have been given an upgrade to Club World in spite of travelling on a Reward Flight. This meant I was able to use the pre-flight supper in the JFK lounge which is so much better than eating during the flight so I was able to maximise sleep. I couldn't have been more pleased with the service I received on both legs.

Actually had a very tasty steak out of EZE which was pink great! But full English breakfast is best avoided the continental choice was excellent. On schedule both ways and landed 30 minutes early both ways. Baggage arrived very promptly. For once there were no long queues at EZE. (Buenos Aires).

As a regular traveller with BA I know the ""Club"" product well and this seat is a lot more cramped than the older 777 product. What BA risk when they downsize a product is insulting the regular traveller whom WILL notice and take offence and fly with someone else.

My flight from Bangkok to Heathrow was horrendous. Travelled World Traveller plus which is a total waste of money. We were served a meal within the first couple of hours of the 12 hour 35 minute flight. I was offered beef or Fish. It was actually Chicken. Apart from a tub of Ice Cream the next meal was not for another 8/9 hours. When the meal did arrive it was Pasta or Chicken. I asked for chicken. It was Fish! It was also vile. Sent it back. Judging back the food going up and down the aisle so did several others. I went to the back of the cabin for a cup if tea. I was advised if I wanted more tea could I retain the paper cup as they were running out!!! It was like being on some 3rd World airline. This is BA. Supposedly the flagship airline of our country.

This was the third reschedule and BA charged 433.40 533.90 and 275.00 successively on a basic $1822.00 economy flight. No other airline does this in my experience. Incredibly my travel agency could not reserve me a window seat ahead of time - unless I paid an extra $53.00 for each flight. I did so but was given an aisle seat on the outbound flight anyway. Both overseas legs were on 747s that were extremely cramped for someone over 6 ft. tall. On the way out my antiquated in-flight display did not work. On the way back my headphone jack was broken. We left Heathrow 90 minutes late due to a computer glitch but for the next 12 hours the BA website indicated on time arrival so my wife waited two hours extra at SFO. Overall a very poor experience.

My entertainment system was not available for three hours despite being told that it could easily be re-set. (No one was available to do it). When it did become available it was lights-out time and my seat would not recline. It was not possible to focus on the screen with the reclined seat in front at such close quarters. Two stewardesses thought the seat belt was preventing the seat from reclining but when this was not the reason no one else came to investigate. No one seemed to care that I needed to stand for long periods to relieve my back. Being polite and patient did me no good. I have several questions. How often are the seats serviced? Why is the entertainment system so unreliable? How often are the seat belts checked because mine kept slipping?

british-airways;M Cooper;United States;2015-03-04;British Airways general onboard services in First are generally acceptable. However the airline refuses to acknowledge that premium ground services should be added for paid First class passengers. Ground services such as special assistance for transfers that are so widely available on other carriers for their First class passengers are sorely lacking at BA (ex. Lufthansa First Class terminal and transfers at FRA and others). Even as a Gold Executive Club top tier member there is nothing available - even when I call and request assistance on long-haul First flights (ex. LHR to HKG) that involve changes in planes between T3 and T5 at LHR. BA needs to wake up and examine the overall First product. The upgrades to the First cabin are also marginal. Packing 14 narrow (even on new A380s) seats in First puts the airline at a huge disadvantage to other OneWorld carriers who have a true First product (ex. Cathay has 8 true suites in First). Wake up BA - your premium fare paying customers are irate over this lack of First product amenities including full ground support (especially upon special request) for paying First passengers.;First Class;5.0;2.0;4.0;4.0;3.0;3.0;0

My 15 year old son and I travelled from LHR-NYC on BA but it was a code-share with American Airlines. I couldn't check in online so we stood in the long queue and couldn't book an aisle seat either. BA at the airport apparently couldn't help because it was a code-share even though I had bought through BA! The flight was on time and seats a reasonable size. Coming back we flew from Washington Dulles airport - there was a snow storm and it was freezing. The plane which was an Airbus 380 was supposed to leave at 6.35pm and showing departing ""on time"" not until 6.15 pm on the 21st Feb. Then BA Announced a 20 min delay which sounded reasonable considering the weather outside and all the other planes were delayed or cancelled! We were all boarded on the plane when they announced the plane was too heavy to be pushed out and there was too much snow behind the plane so they called the snow ploughs! We sat on the plane for 6 hours with no food or refreshments except water! There was nowhere for us go apparently so we couldn't get off the plane. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that with all the snow and a huge airplane that there would be large problems. The final straw was after 5 hrs and the third attempt to move the plane was that we had to sit for another 45 mins defrosting the wings! British Airways were not prepared to cancel or reschedule the flight but instead made us sit like cattle on the airplane. It's a disgrace and we they will probably put it down to bad weather and not negligence bad planning or bad management on their part!

My seat was picked as 53K Upper Deck. I couldn't believe how cramped it was for this long journey. The divider partition was covered in red wine stains from a previous trip and staff seemed nonchalant about cleanliness. The available width of BA's offering is a big disappointment. Whilst those socially awkward individuals might enjoy the clandestine surroundings I for one do not favour the casket-feel of Club World. The A380 and 787 were a chance to hone the business class offering after much criticism. Execution of the flight was prompt and we pushed back on schedule. I fly a lot for work and am privileged to enjoy the premium cabins but poor attention to detail and very slow service don't inspire a return to a specific carrier. One alcoholic drink was offered just after take off and then the all too familiar menu was wheeled out. BA's menu for this flight was identical to a return LHR-MIA-LHR leg I took back in early December. Lacklustre choices and the infamous warm chicken breast salad. Maybe I was tired and didn't endear myself but it needs to be better. I recently flew the A380 with AF to LAX in Business and that was a role reversal! No limp and greasy bacon sandwich on AF either. LAX Teminal B a massive improvement over the years. From fast immigration to pleasant design it's the leader in aspiring all US airports to improve their standards and get rid of carpet underfoot!

The aisle was so narrow that it was impossible to put my carry-on bag in the overhead over my seat. Very claustrophobic. Seat was strange. Very narrow and difficult to sleep in - at least 6-7"" narrower than the seats on CX or AA. Strange recline mechanism - normally you can adjust the recline and the foot rest separately but not in here. The seat reclines in one motion so you can't ""fine tune"" it like with other airlines. Menu looked fantastic - apps were good salad was nothing special and the main course (Indian style Lamb) was virtually inedible. Cheeses were good desserts and wines OK.

We will travel with British Airways every time we could not fault them in any way. Just one minor thing that is no fault of British Airways. When they call the flight there is a dedicated boarding row for First Class passengers but it seemed that everyone was able to use this lane which means that we had to join the queue rather than just walk straight through.

british-airways;John Ince;United Kingdom;2015-02-18;On a recent flight from Johannesburg to London I was shocked to find such cramped seating conditions in the World Traveller economy class section. Having not been able to secure an aisle seat (which would have made minimal difference anyway) I was allocated a middle seat of 3. Like many other men (and some women) I am over 6 ft. with long legs so the acute discomfort I experienced was manifest from the start of the flight to the end about 10 hours. It was difficult to stretch my legs and at times I had to stand in my seat to alleviate leg cramp. It also caused me considerable back pain. I did offer to swap seats with a lady in the adjacent aisle seat but she was unwilling to do so that was her prerogative. So it became necessary to disturb her on a number of occasions to take a walk along the aisles in order to alleviate leg cramps. The cabin staff were co-operative in allowing me to use one of their seats in order to stretch my legs but had to return to mine during a period of turbulence. Reading very similar reviews it does make me wonder if British Airways will bother take any notice or continue to treat their passengers (customers) in this appalling fashion. About 10 years ago I experienced an appalling flight from Buenos Aires to London via British Airways (albeit for different reasons) and swore I would never use them again.

The plane had the new Club Europe seats and it reminded me how well BA seem to be in missing the opportunity to develop a product that could be really high in quality - but isn't. Unless you are seated in row ""1"" - the leg room is appalling and the same as economy. As with the old C.E. seat - the centre seat between 3 seats - is a table. Quite why this is logical escapes me - because it seems to imply that if it suits BA they will at a whim seat three passengers and not two. This was a grand opportunity to stand out from the competition and clearly establish a comfortable - wide C.E. seat. At the same time justify the higher pricing. Its no wonder BA have very few - if any - Travel Industry awards in the services they provide. So frustrating. I had another light lunch and a couple of Gin and Tonics which was nice.

The boarding took place on time and we were offered pre takeoff drinks soon after seating. Take off was a bit delayed but smooth non the less. The food leaves a lot to be desired on BA I had the Salmon main course which was very bland. The up side the champagne was perfectly chilled and the desert was yummy. The seat configuration is not the best as you are facing your neighbour. The seat in the lounging position is very comfy but is a bit narrow for sleeping it's also a bit short for taller individuals such as myself.

When I told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away.

The dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that I was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight.

Although clearly an older bird the new interior has a very comfortable and warm feel to it - yet also modern. Nice and comfy leather seats leg room just sufficient for flight under say 2 hours. Service is as expected a quick drink and some nuts (though a sandwich would be nice on a mid-morning flight). They are clearly matching their product with the competition on this route as free newspapers where available upon boarding contrary to the intercontinental stretch. LHR-JFK-LHR on B744 totally different experience. Transferring through T5 at LHR easy enough although I got the feeling they like to control the passenger flow to the max - but hey this is the UK after all. Also BA advertise T5 as like it's one building - not the case. All this was acceptable until we found out we were being directed to a bus gate. They actually board a fully booked B744 through busses with one stairway and door available for the entire plane. Given all the 788's completely cold and dark occupying the airbridges I felt this was totally unnecessary. Turned out to be a very dated 744 with mostly Club World and First seats as the economy plus and economy consisted of only 2 cabin sections together rest of the plane premium product. How to lose your premium clientele at warp speed. Prime example! Service on board was nice enough food pretty ok and plenty of drinks to choose from. Seats dated and sometimes broken - my adjustable headrest would adjust only to slide back down slowly same problem on both sectors. IFE well just bring your own tablet. So dated it's just not worth switching on. The cabin crew made the difference though on all sectors they were welcoming friendly yet professional and very helpful. Arriving early morning from JFK of course we parked at a hard stand. Waited our turn for 20+ minutes in a non ventilated cabin to get in the bus with only one exit in use. BA this is not acceptable. Disembarking a commuter plane up to 100 pax with buses well ok. But a fully loaded 744? Come on.;Economy;4.0;3.0;4.0;3.0;1.0;4.0;0
british-airways;C Harper;United Kingdom;2015-02-11;Out from LHR to JNB on 14th Jan flight BA55 check in poor as we were e-tickets had nothing but passports and destination never had a problem before but was more like a quiz at a pub. Also advised that we would have to pick up our luggage at JNB and check in again at JNB for MUB so we wasted time looking for luggage which was being transferred. We have never liked the premium economy seats on BA but connections in JNB made it necessary to travel BA. Seats have plenty of knee room and general space is good but are far to hard after a couple of hours my backside begins to suffer. Crew were good. As far as airline food goes it was reasonable. Return on BA56 on 29th Jan same problems on seats also toilet nearest to our seats was out of order and without treading on people you have to walk to the end of the aircraft for an alternative also when sitting in premium economy it is not possible to see toilet lights as all are behind you.

The away leg (BA16) was quite good except for the meal which was barely edible. The flight back had a much improved meal but the entertainment system had repeated issues and had to be restarted about 4 times. Another problem with the return leg (BA15) is that if you get on the plane in Singapore and not in London by the time online check-in is open for you there are almost no seats to choose from. I wanted a window seat and had not a single window to choose from at the moment the online check-in opened for me. Service on both flights was good. I was feeling a bit dehydrated and asked for plenty of water on the return flight and had no problems at all. All the staff was nice and accommodating.;Economy;7.0;3.0;5.0;4.0;4.0;4.0;1
british-airways;R Simpson;Australia;2015-02-06;My wife and I flew business class LHR-HKG 23/1/15 on a 777-200 seats 11 E&F. Check-in was ok once it got started this took several minutes as the woman at the counter was chatting with 2 friends. The lounge was good overall if a bit crowded and over heated. There was snack type offerings until 6.30pm when hot food was supplied This was very well cooked and presented the Thai green curry was excellent so compliments to the chef. Boarding was on time and efficient unlike our previous BA experience at HKG. We found the middle seats on this plane a bit cramped but comfortable for sleeping. The inflight food was very good I had a chicken and rice dish my wife had braised beef which she says was excellent I do think dessert and cheese should be offered. Unlike our last BA flight 5 weeks ago the crew on this flight were excellent friendly and attentive. The IFE selection is fair but the screen is square and is small compared to that on the A380 (and very small compared to CX). Thanks to the FA's we had a very enjoyable trip. We would fly BA again but only if the price was very competitive the staffing inconsistencies worry me some what this is really a management issue and should be addressed if it were the BA brand would be more competitive.;Business Class;6.0;3.0;5.0;4.0;2.0;2.0;1

The food was very good too lovely and hot large portions of chicken/beef tasty liked the choices given so we were very happy. The new seat configuration on the Airbus we did not like we were in row 8 then 6 and they were fine but I'd not like to be in the first row right by the door and noticeably colder (stood right by the row queuing for the loo) and there is no bulkhead any more so it's a very small open space between the first row of seats the loo and the galley! I'm only 5 ft 2 tall and very slim build and I found the loo cramped looking around I couldn't see how 1/3 of the passengers would fit in it and I don't mean they were all way overweight it is very small and slanting roof. A tall and big built person would not be happy! I gave inflight entertainment 1 as obviously they don't exist on short haul flights. The seats were far too upright and therefore uncomfortable you could only recline them a bit or otherwise the poor person behind you wouldn't have had any space and I kept sliding forward on mine. The leg rest has gone too so I had nothing to stop me moving forward and the space between rows felt a lot reduced.;Business Class;9.0;3.0;5.0;5.0;1.0;4.0;1

A real disappointment after a series of long haul flights in the new cabin. This really needs replaced. Anyone who has not flown with BA before would leave with a terrible impression. Seats worn cramped and many falling apart with outdated IFE. Food and drinks service usual good standard though. Please BA get rid of this old interior once and for all.

british-airways;P Ellis;United Kingdom;2015-01-28;We travelled BA in Business class LHR to Vegas before Xmas and returned to LHR from San Diego in January. Business Class travel is a rare treat for us and I can't understand why BA persevere with this unique forwards/backwards facing seating layout. To sit for 11 hours face to face with a stranger is awful as is the lack of space created by the curved partition between the seats. The cabin crew were great food was below average and the inflight entertainment system abysmal: poor choice and terrible picture quality. Outbound we were upstairs on a 747 there were two attendants assisting only 16 passengers and they did a good job and kept the two toilets clean. Given these circumstances this flight experience should have been fantastic. However given the negatives detailed above I would classify it as just about average. We returned on a 777 and my negative feelings are sadly the same other than we were stuck on the plane for 40 mins on landing awaiting buses to disembark.;Business Class;5.0;3.0;4.0;3.0;2.0;3.0;0

Seat was comfortable and certainly better than sitting in the back of the plane. However we think this configuration is a failed experiment by BA. Eight seats across is too many for Business Class. The seats were too narrow. The backward facing seats are disconcerting for two reasons: If you are traveling with a spouse or friend and neither likes to face backwards you can't sit together. Secondly when the divider is down you stare at a stranger 15 inches away. Hope BA reverts to the old style one day.;Business Class;7.0;4.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;3.0;1

Because of ""mist"" (the pilot's actual characterization) most flights that morning had been delayed/canceled in/out of LHR. No delay info given at check-in nor at gate. Upon boarding the captain informed us that because of ""mist"" we were being held on the ground for 2 hours. My connecting flight to SFO was 2.5 hrs after landing in LHR. Flight attendant assured me most flights were being delayed therefore mine to SFO most likely too. Upon landing in LHR a sea of canceled/delayed lost souls. I was immediately told I was forced to miss my connection because my flight to SFO was on time. I was forced to join the longest line I've ever seen for rebooking. It never moved. We were told another set of rebooking desks were available upstairs ""and faster"". Crossing the border control took just as long. Upstairs it took me 5 hours just to get closer to the desks but still at least a couple hours away. I finally managed to join the free wifi and call BA's office to get rebooked online. I was rebooked on a flight from SFO to LHR. The wrong way around. When I pointed out the obvious the agent told me there was a ""computer glitch"" and promised to call me back. She finally called me back and got rebooked on AA flights to JFK and to SFO from there. The next morning at the AA check in they could not check me in on the JFK-SFO because of ""issues with the BA ticket"". It took 90 minutes and multiple interactions with 3 different desks to get it solved. I nearly missed the flight to JFK too. My suitcase was never loaded on that flight and I didn't get it at JFK.

british-airways;Charles Green;United Kingdom;2015-01-28;Return flight from LHR T5 to Washington Dulles (IAD) in Club World. Check in was fine even if the layout of the T5 check-in area isn't the most intuitive. Security was efficient. However the BA lounge was overcrowded and noisy with minimal service and only basic comforts. Outbound flight on the A380. Boarding was rather chaotic due to the gate area being too small for such a large passenger compliment but the flight did push back on-time. The Club World cabin on the upper deck could best be described as grey and functional. It was reasonably clean if not spotless but despite being a relatively new aircraft it did feel slightly shabby already. The Club World seat which was forward facing and on the aisle was comfortable enough. The entertainment screen was rather small and the choice of movies wasn't terribly extensive but everything apart from the in-seat USB power socket was working. The general layout of the cabin was terrible. Not only do window seat and middle row passengers have to step over the legs of aisle seat passengers to get to and from their seats but when the privacy screen between seats is lowered for take-off landing and during meal services you find yourself staring rather disconcertingly close up into your neighbours face. It makes everything feel cramped and cheap. Meals were fine and the crew were polite and efficient. Overall I'd rate the outbound experience as 'Okay' for a business class flight. Return flight experience was far from okay. My flight departing IAD at 10.20 pm was cancelled 6 hours prior to departure due to mechanical issues. Told that there were no Club World seats on the earlier flight out of IAD that night which I could just about make at a push and I would have to fly back in Economy. When I asked about the BA flight from Baltimore (BWI) an hour later I was told that yes there were Club World seats available that evening so I asked to be rebooked onto that flight instead. Arriving at BWI check-in I was informed that unfortunately there actually weren't any Club World seats available and I would have to fly back in World Traveller Plus. The flight from BWI to LHR T5 was on a rather old 767. The cabin interior was dated shabby and cramped with minimal overhead luggage storage. World Traveller Plus seats were cramped and uncomfortable with tiny entertainment screens. In-flight food was bland. The crew were efficient but not terribly friendly. Flight left and arrived on time. As a UK passport holder Immigration at T5 was quick.

On our return trying to obtain a refund for the pre booked seats proved difficult.

There were not enough stewards/stewardesses. Forty minutes before the welcome on board drink - and no small snack not even a small packet of nuts. Seatback TV did not work in the section I was on and the man next to me had to move to another seat. The seatbacks should be checked before the flight. However eventually they did work. A small number of films TV shows I have never heard of and no games option. First meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll. And creamers! Even for tea! Whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. Snacks we had to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount.

I definitely would choose another airline next time. We flew out on 31st December 2014 and the crew were surly and inattentive. Asking for a drink seemed as if it was really putting them out. One of the crew swore when communicating with her colleague during the drinks service within ear shot of us. Outbound they run out of the the meal choice for both very small meals by the time they reached us so we had to had the veggie option. For most of the flight the crew were camped in the galley at the back seemingly having a party with colleagues whether working or not so you felt it was a imposition to ask for water or snacks. My inflight entertainment system had streaks all across which couldn't be rubbed off making the movies very hard to see. Return flight crew on 16th Jan were much less surly but again conspicuous by their absence meaning you had to try and wade through the party at the back to try and get water or snacks during the flight. Two passengers were flicking raisins about the cabin onto other passengers which might have been spotted had the cabin crew had more of a presence. The inflight entertainment system had major issues which meant it didn't work on demand making it hard to plan viewing of movies. Again 2 very small meals at the either end of a 13 hr flight with very limited options for snacks in between. One staff member said they had very little left then allowed a passenger to grab about 5 packets for herself. Tray table was broken in seat 27b also. The crew said as it was an early flight they knew we all wanted to sleep but the flight left just before midday so not what I call a night flight. I used to love flying BA as have always been impressed with their service in the past but now the planes and the crew seem tired and I am sorry to say neither my partner or I enjoyed the experience.

BA must go and have a look at the AF premium product for a wake up call. The food was okay nothing to rave about and perfectly satisfactory service onboard seems friendly and efficient however the state of the uniforms of some of the staff was shocking not sure if its a case of poor quality material or lack of attention to appearances. I do remember the strap line ""BA the worlds favourite airline"" but sadly they have slipped quite a long way back.";Premium Economy;6.0;2.0;4.0;3.0;1.0;3.0;0
british-airways;R Franklin;United Kingdom;2015-01-19;Cairo-LHR-SFO-LHR: Overall BA are suffering from a fleet which desperately needs replacing. The 747 to SFO must have been 20 odd years old and looked it. Ancient IFE with tiny screen virtually inaudible sound and minuscule choice. Seats were ok actually moderately comfortable for economy staff better than they used to be. The flight from Cairo on a much newer Airbus A320 in a long haul configuration was much better. Big IFE screen lots of movie choice comfortable seat charming cabin crew shows what could be with a newer fleet. As a Brit this itinerary was a rare chance to see what transferring through LHR is like well I just made my connection but why oh why have they designed such a massive T5 only to put a bottle neck of 5 or ten transfer desks for the tens of thousands changing planes every few hours? That transfer hall should be massive and full of staff rather than anxious travellers fretting about missing their connection. If I were BA I would sort that or else keep losing transfers to Schiphol or CDG. Overall I get the impression BA is living off the captive market London provides- hundreds of thousands of very rich people wanting long haul direct flying for which there is no competition. If there is ever global de-regulation BA's long haul business will go the way of short haul with Emirates playing easyJet's role this time.;Economy;6.0;4.0;3.0;2.0;2.0;4.0;0
british-airways;S Morley;United States;2015-01-19;Washington (IAD) to Heathrow on Christmas Day returning January 5th. I find myself nodding in agreement to many of the reviews written here by other passengers regarding the slippage in standards of BA especially considering what they once were. Having arrived at Dulles in good time to check in there were paper notices on the desk to say that check in would not open 'til 5.00 pm. Okay it was Christmas Day but all other carriers both domestic and international were open (the airport was busy) and I along with other passengers had to sit and wait for 1.5 hrs until staff arrived. The same was true of the lounge which having made it through security was not open 'til 6.30 pm. Again the other airline lounges were open. Having eventually gained access the lounge was great and the bar and dinner service (I was on a sleeper flight) were very good with plentiful drinks and fine food. We boarded on time and my seat was upstairs on the A380. This aircraft is of course huge but the Club World seat is as many have noted much less comfortable than the Boeing 777 or 747. It is narrower and whilst okay for seating very hard and difficult to find the right position for sleeping. BA seem to have missed a great opportunity here to do something really special along the lines of some of the Asian carriers. The crew were very good - friendly and attentive. Breakfast before we landed was very average. The bacon rolls were dried out and are always a challenge to eat. Yoghurt and fruit were the alternatives which I went for. Check in for the return journey was lamentable at Heathrow Terminal 5. Dedicated Club World positions had queues around ten people deep and moved terribly slowly. Not all the positions were open and passengers were visibly irritated. The journey other than the cramped seat issue again was fine with another good crew and food and drinks. I have always recommended BA to friends and would like to keep doing so but feel that especially given the high and rising cost of paying for Club these days BA need to adopt a slightly less 'take' attitude and give a little more especially when it comes to spending Avios which they are very keen for one to accrue but reticent to allow one to use.;Business Class;7.0;2.0;4.0;4.0;4.0;3.0;1
british-airways;Derek Greenaway;United Kingdom;2015-01-19;LGW-MLA. For some crazy reason I still fly British Airways and pay for Club Europe. Following this trip I have come to my senses. Apart from a Berlin trip already paid for in May they can say goodbye to my business travel. This was an Airbus 320 previously owned by BMI. It was not difficult to work that out as it was still showing the BMI banner inside. The plane was never used for business. All the seats were a miserable 30 inch pitch. There was not even a curtain dividing club and economy. Just how BA think they are going to get away with this type of robbery for much longer I don't know. Unless there is an alternative carrier offering proper club facilities then its low cost airlines for me around Europe.;Business Class;1.0;1.0;3.0;2.0;1.0;1.0;0

Food: lots of cold cuts cheeses and some pastries. Plane: rather dated 747 and not very clean. FA's very courteous and extremely friendly - great choice of very good champagnes wines and spirits. Where BA fails: the poor quality of the food - extremely basic without any luxury items - not acceptable at all for a First product - IFE just ok. Seat kk - FA gave assistance for the sleeping position. Connecting flight to Brussels: I was informed by the - once again very friendly and courteous FA - that BA did cancel the fruit platter as a special meal. Is fruit also too expensive?

british-airways;Worcester David;United Kingdom;2015-01-19;LHR-HKG-LHR in First. A brief trip to celebrate New Year in Honkers. Pleasant First class check in average Fast Track and warm welcome in the Concorde Room. Escorted to a table for 3. Excellent meal and service. My salmon tartare was nice enough and the Lamb was very tender rounded off by a sticky toffee and date pudding which was good but next time more clotted cream please. I enjoyed a couple of glasses of champagne and a nice pinot noir. Boarded at C64 escorted to my seat after a very warm personal welcome. Champagne slippers pj's and an amenity kit proffered. Crew seem excellent. They will also bring us home on New Year's day. After take off drinks (bloody mary for me) and an amuse-bouche. My friends indulged in a full meal but I just had the Cauliflower Soup which was very tasty. My friend's Profiteroles looked yummy. The crew were very attentive to us all. After being taken on a tour of the 777 by Kim I slept for 4 hours or so before indulging in a full English. Got changed before landing. An excellent flight with an excellent crew. Coming home. After a pleasant supper in the Qantas lounge we were escorted to the front of the queue and welcomed on board by our now familiar crew. Champagne settled us down and after take off my dinner was predicated with an amuse-bouche of beef carpaccio prawn and balik salmon with olive oil caviar followed by lamb washed down with a rather nice Medoc with a cheese plate conclusion. After a good night's sleep I woke to a cup of English Breakfast tea and orange juice whilst my friends had the full works. Quick disembarkation.

british-airways;Ian Robinson;United Kingdom;2015-01-19;We flew from Gatwick to Jamaica in November. Check in was easy and very quick and we were soon in the lounge. The lounge as usual was comfortable but with a very poor selection of food. As we were there around 09.15 I had hoped to have a hot breakfast but in the end the only hot dish available was porridge which I didn't fancy so we settled for tea and cakes. The departure gate was not the biggest and as a result it all got a bit messy with the staff trying coral the CW passengers in to a separate area to board first. On board most things were OK and the staff are very efficient and helped to make the experience a good one. The return from Kingston was pretty much the same although the check in was slower. However this was compensated by an excellent lounge (Club Kingston) that served nice hot and cold snacks and then escorted you to the departure area. As usual the crew turned the lights down as soon as dinner was cleared away but I did manage to read for a while and then sleep for 3 to 4 hours. Overall quite good and based on this experience I would recommend this product.;Business Class;7.0;4.0;5.0;4.0;3.0;4.0;1
british-airways;M Gibson;United Kingdom;2015-01-19;San Diego-LHR-MAN. On 6th January we flew from San Diego to Manchester UK via Heathrow. After flying out on Christmas Day via LAX on the A380 this flight was a welcome return to form for BA's Club World offering. The San Diego Admiral's Club lounge is currently undergoing refurbishment but is still a nice space and unlike the UK lounges upon arrival we were offered a menu not just a 'self serve' buffet. When it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the A380 the staff at San Diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft glass of bubbly in hand in minutes. The cabin crew were much friendlier and professional than those on the outward flight as this is smaller cabin with fewer passengers you definitely felt that you were the 'premium' customer your ticket price would suggest and nothing was too much trouble. Drinks were constantly topped up food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. The entertainment system might not have been quite as impressive as on the A380 but considering we slept for a large portion of this 10 hour flight that was unimportant. After a very average outward flight on the A380 into LA this superb flight home on the smaller aircraft restored my faith in BA's club offering and means that for future trips to the West Coast we will be flying direct into San Diego rather than LAX.;Business Class;10.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;3.0;5.0;1

british-airways;E McIver;United Kingdom;2015-01-19;LHR - Helsinki in Business Class. I happened to fly on this flight as I booked a flight to Shanghai with Finnair in business and BA are a Oneworld partner. Although the cabin crew were very attentive I feel that Club Europe is not worth the extra money considering the length of flight and extra services provided. The aircraft was a brand new A320 with leather seats but there was no extra legroom in the Club Europe section. The seats were the same as in the economy section the only difference being that the middle seat is not in use. There is a movable partition separating the two cabins presumably to offer maximum flexibility for the airline. Hot towels were provided before takeoff but no welcome drinks. The generous bar service started shortly after take off followed by a rather disappointing meal. Considering that it was a 2.5h lunchtime flight all that was on offer was a cold meat platter with a salad and a bread roll. I have had better service in Economy on BA short hall flights in the late 90s. Furthermore I recently flew on a China Eastern Airlines domestic flight of similar length on business class on a new A320 and the seats were in a 4-abreast configuration with much more legroom and I was served with a hot meal! There was no personal entertainment - the overhead screens showed the moving map for the duration of the flight. I do like BA but if you are flying short hall and are considering Club Europe I suggest saving your money and flying in the economy cabin. These low ratings reflect my expectations of business class and not the airline overall.;Business Class;6.0;2.0;4.0;2.0;1.0;1.0;1

The 777 has more room in the cabin than the 747 flight to London which I appreciated especially when it came to my bed. Seat 2A is private and roomy. It was a full flight so service was efficient and friendly if not a little rushed. Overall the service was at the great BA standard. What was lacking was the meal was lacking the freshness and taste which was disappointing. There was major (1hr) delay in planing at JFK which was not BA's fault but really made this flight much longer than it should had been.

On a recent return flight from Johannesburg travelling with an infant we were delayed for over 30 hours. The way in which the delay was handled was terrible. Minimal staff meant it took three plus hours to get checked in to a hotel. Then trying to arrange the return minimising waiting time for the little one took 5 hours with two staff serving 400 passengers with no concern for customers.

Check in and boarding were extremely smooth at Manchester and the lounge was also quiet due to the fact it was a holiday.Upon arrival LHR was much busier so much so that we struggled to find a seat in the south lounge. When it came time to board the aircraft it was quite frankly carnage. There didn't seem to be any real system and we had to fight through the crowds just to be able to get in the (long) line for Club passengers. The downside of such a big aircraft is the number of passengers even in Club world. Once on board it was a fairly standard offering Club World on BA is pretty consistent across all aircraft I now find. Seat and service were all fine not exceptional but acceptable. My one main gripe us that we were seated on the lower deck (seats 13A and 13B) and on our side of the plane there was only one tiny bathroom which often led to a line. The other side of the aircraft had two bathrooms but getting to them meant going all the way round the galley kitchen and cabin staff in there were often busy working or just hanging out and it seemed that they weren't too keen on being disturbed. Whilst there's no doubt the A380 is a quieter aircraft I feel its size and the number of passengers takes something away from the level of service which you'd expect to be high given the price paid for Club World tickets.;Business Class;6.0;5.0;2.0;4.0;5.0;3.0;1

I wonder what genius came up with that one. Aside from serving us ""steerage"" passengers that stuff they called food and a drink we never saw the cabin crew in both directions.

What I found completely annoying was the lack of air-bridges both on departure and arrival at T5 Heathrow. We were herded on to buses like cattle closely resembling the tube at rush hour and then had to climb steep steps into the aircraft no easy feat with heavy hand luggage and duty free. Are there not enough gates with air bridges at T5? Why is this necessary.

Being next to the windows it was hard to hear the cabin announcements as the air circulation is quite loud. The windows are different as the change colour instead of the usual blinds. The seat design is very poor for those in seat a rows 1 2 and 6 as they have to step over the person in the row in front if they are lying down. 3A has its own access to the aisle. The seat is ok and does go to a flat bed but with it only being 6ft a lot of people will not be able to stretch out.

british-airways;A Singh;United Kingdom;2015-01-11;Los Angeles - Heathrow - Los Angeles over the holidays. Club world is a perfectly fine business product. Staff on both legs were very good getting the job done in a polite and friendly way. Food again is pretty good and benefits from covering the basics well and not being overly fussy. Portion sizes not huge but I don't need the calories anyway. Plenty of drinks offered. An unexpected nice touch was when during the outbound night flight as the only passenger awake a crew member popped her head over asked if I was ok and if I would like a hot chocolate - and then went and made one. In terms of product this is not a million miles away from United business (both even have backwards-facing seats). However the BA cabin crew are in a class of their own and it feels like they know it which translates in to good service. United's intercontinental crews are a somewhat more eclectic group whose get-up-and-go appears to have got-up-and-gone. Just like with the 747 the upstairs on the A380 has side storage which is useful. The upstairs front section bathrooms are also huge (and from the front section you can go up and down the stairs if that tickles your fancy). But downstairs is light and roomy. On return on Dec 29 I was delayed at the gate at Heathrow as staff fussed over various 'company' passengers that needed to be accommodated. These company passengers - flight crew heading off on vacation - then unluckily sat next to me in Club and behaved appallingly for 11 hours - drinking champagne constantly loudly talking all night and demanding a running commentary on the ins-and-outs of working the A380 from every crew member that passed. They acted like children who had never been on a plane before - and their taking 'selfies' (that included me in the background!) all flight was mildly vexing. Upshot? As long as BA doesn't stiff you by putting its staff on freebie upgrades next to you you'll enjoy club world on the A380.;Business Class;8.0;4.0;5.0;4.0;4.0;5.0;1

A good choice of beverages available and I consumed around 3 glasses of champagne and port during my main meal. Had the steak which were okay for an airline meal. The club kitchen was pretty well stocked with sandwiches fruit chocolate cakes and champagne in plenty of supply. A light meal was offered around 90 minutes before landing I had the afternoon tea (sandwiches) my wife a salad. Some excellent warm scones were provided. I was happy with my choice but my wife thought the salad too light for a secondary meal. Overall the food was okay but I have had better on Singapore Airlines ANZ and even AA. The IFE system was dated with the screen being not as sharp as other airlines and the choice of movies limited compared to other airlines. On the return journey I slept most of the flight after the meal. My wife reported the club kitchen was well stocked contrary to some reports it is often empty on flights returning to Heathrow. A very positive note to report the BA lounge at SFO is excellent a good choice of food and drink excellent space and I loved the direct access to the air bridge.;Business Class;10.0;5.0;5.0;3.0;3.0;5.0;1

When we boarded the aircraft my wife asked for a glass of champagne while we waited for take-off and the hostess said 'I would have to open another bottle'. She then walked away and did not return. Given the cost of the ticket we would have bought that bottle many many times over. I like to watch movies or the map of our progress and on a flight of over 8 hours this is important to me. You guessed it the video system did not work at all for me nor for several other customers around me. I did complain and have been offered compensation of £60 but only against the cost of another BA ticket.

The only comfortable section of the journey was the short trip to and from London. The Dreamliner is narrow and uncomfortable. We had read the reviews and were hopeful it would be better than the reviews. The 3-3-3 seating is far too cramped with narrow seats the leg room was just about acceptable. We sat in the back row of the front cabin of economy by choice as it reduced the risk of being kicked from behind. It was a good choice but pick the side without rest rooms behind you as the toilets are very noisy and busy. The food was typical air line food. The crew were variable. On the outward journey the crew were great but on the return less pleasant. The lights were dimmed late in the flight and the crew did not use the variable lighting to gradually light the cabin and just flicked the switch.

Yes the luggage rack moved to eye level. It does not give the 4 inches or so lost by moving the seats closer together. Seats are also very hard and extremely uncomfortable.

Flight was on an old Boeing 767 - the seating was a bit too firm and not very comfortable. This seat was an exit row so leg room was superb. Gets a little cold here but OK for a flight of this duration. No personal video on demand just old overhead screen system so next to useless. They replace the seats but not the entertainment system and on a flight like this of over four hours it should be better. Food was pretty good with a choice of salad or hot meal with the usual free beverages.

The seats are no longer that comfortable with the window passenger having to step over the feet of the total stranger in the next row to get into the aisle. The entertainment? Really poor! But worst of all the food! I would have been disappointed to get rubbish like that served in Economy but when one has paid thousands of pounds for the privilege? The breakfast was a joke. A glass of orange juice accompanied by a few slices of fruit and melon and the offer of a tiny bacon roll!

british-airways;R Simon;Austria;2015-01-05;"LIS-LHR-VIE on Dec. 8 both legs on an Airbus 320 in Club Europe (Business Class) - both legs on time seats were Economy seats with the middle seat left unsold and featuring the new slim seats which are less comfortable and have a reduced seat pitch – Check-in in LIS was handled by rather surly agents which was untypical for an otherwise friendly airport but Business class waiting lines were very short so overall it was OK. LIS-LHR leg was with a rather lacklustre and inattentive European fleet crew after the initial service of food and drinks further service consisted of clearing the dishes and on board sales. Other than that Business class flight attendants were behind the curtain reading magazines chatting and rather attending to themselves than the passengers. At 11 am the Business Class food served was a plate cold cuts a roll and three thin slices of fruit (basically a make yourself sandwich on a plate). Extremely disappointing and poor for a lunch flight scheduled to arrive in Heathrow after 1 pm. On the LHR-VIE leg service was“afternoon tea”meaning again sandwiches. However this time at least it was more appropriate due to time of day. Full bar service on both flights and the French white wine served was ok. The mixed fleet crew on the second leg was more interested in its job and up to BA standards regarding friendliness and attentiveness. Transfer procedures in LHR Terminal 3 were fast and friendly even the extra security checks required for all transfers at LHR (even Intra-EU) were hassle free and easy. BA’s Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 was again an oasis of rest amid a busy airport; comfortable with excellent drink selection and decent food selection including several good warm choices such as various curries. In Lisbon Portela BA uses the shared Blue Lounge which is small and offerings are rather limited; some limited snacks ok drinks but at least good Nespresso coffee. Although small it was not crowded which is a plus. So BA delivered a good basic product for economy standards but I fail to see any real Business Class service offered here (not seat wise not meal wise not service wise). The only saving grace was the Galleries Lounge in Heathrow T3 and the better service on the LHR-VIE leg. Not recommended for Business Class within Europe based on this experience.

Not good enough to pay the extra and then have to sit at an angle to fit into the seat. New seats are uncomfortable as well. Lunch service reminiscent of Economy food trays of the 80s too. Cabin crew doing their best with a full club cabin - CE clearly still popular for the moment even with revised cabin layout but for how much longer? Can no longer recommend BA for a four hour short-haul although good time-keeping. Such a shame that BA has allowed this to happen. Think again BA.;Business Class;3.0;1.0;4.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;0

british-airways;Clive V Drake;United Kingdom;2014-12-31;"Washington - LHR. We arrived early for our 18.30 departure as we intended eating in the new BA Executive lounge. It is about two months old and is a very good set up indeed. Plenty of seating that is well spread out and comfortable. The food was plentiful freshly cooked both varied and tasty. No complaints so far. We were seated in the two most forward seats on the upper deck of the A380. Seats 50A and 50B. I was happy facing my wife - but really would not be happy to be staring at a stranger for a longish flight. I hope this weird seating design is changed in the near future. It was the so called latest Club World seat in a rather gloomy grey colour. In fact the whole cabin ambiance is different tones of grey. It has been some time since I have flown Club - the last being on a 777 to Antigua in 2010. I am absolutely sure this ""new"" seat is smaller. We pushed back on time and as soon as the lights dimmed I well put it this way tried to get some sleep. It was a horrendous experience. In 35 years of aviation travel I have completed hundreds of flights and this was by far the worse - ever ! I simply could not get comfortable and drift off to sleep. The temperature was fine. Noise level was minimal. The ""bed"" was rock hard. To narrow. To short. The seat controls were fiddly and not user friendly. I arrived into LHR without so much as 15 minutes of sleep. I had no difficulty in sleeping on the 777 Club product - and back then I was 20 kilos heavier. This product is not cheap (On some sectors its as high as £7000 return) - although we purchased our tickets on Avios - with a 1st Class outbound and Club return.

I had a good window seat with direct aisle access and fortunately the cabin was not particularly busy so the toilet did not cause any disturbance. I find the seat very comfortable for eating lounging and sleeping although a mattress topper would make sleeping even more comfortable. The half folding table is great when you just have a drink or your phone charging but of course this has to become the table when a meal service starts so it is a shame there isn't a separate table. The inflight entertainment is excellent I do not understand any criticism of this as the screen is large and good quality and there is a large choice of films and TV. The catering however continues to be poor with BA. While the menu sounds great and dishes generally look good they often fall down when you actually eat them. As this was an overnight flight the meals were designed lighter and the champagne and canapés starter sounded perfect they were however 3 limp tasteless bite sized things. This to me is BA's weakest area and they really need to improve their catering offering in order to compete with other airlines.

british-airways;D Choy;United Kingdom;2014-12-31;LHR-SFO - Club World. I find myself nodding to the negative yet factual feedbacks of others regarding BA's premium products. Online check in and boarding were smooth and uneventful. That is it! Whoever designed the club world seat needs to have their head examined. The board that signed off on the product should be fired! The seat was narrowed with no space to put your drinks without lowering the dining table. That is just plain stupid. Having to step over another pax to get out of your seat (if seated in window) is another stupid concept! The design offers absolutely no privacy if seated in the aisle. The food was okay nothing to brag about and definitely not at the level expected to see in premium class (compared to the likes of Air France or Lufthansa). Entertainment selection were poor but better than KLM and the screen not of good size. Fly crews were ok. I ordered the beef and the pax next to me did the same. Even though my order was first my neighbour got the last order. Fair enough ended up with Turkey roulade was ok. The crews were apologetic but not attentive. Having flew other carriers I can honestly say theirs little enthusiasm shown by the crew which is a shame. Had an opportunity to look at the 1st class menu. To be frank any carrier who does not offer caviar's in its first class cabin in my view is out with the time. Making this observation because in 2 months I will be travelling to Mexico and the price comparison between Lufthansa and BA are not far apart (former slightly less) but I suspect flying Lufthansa is likely to be more enjoyable than BA based on the experienced of this journey. Will see if the return flight might tilt the view to the (+). I would not pay the published C or F class fares on BA. The product line does not equate to the price.

Finally when the Club World cabin ran out of tonic water there was no attempt made by the cabin crew to go and check the trolleys in a different cabin it was a case of sorry there's none in this trolley so you can't have any.

This saddens me that they have made a clear decision that on holiday type routes they will provide the absolute minimum on everything. One example that shows how pathetic it has become with cutbacks out of many problems I encountered on these routes is that the food was so awful on the Cancun flight recently that we merely asked for cheese and biscuits in business class to be told that we could only have one packet of two biscuits each as BA only allocated one packet per person.

british-airways;Robert Wright;United Kingdom;2014-12-22;TPA - LGW on Dec 10th in PE. BA have total monopoly on the London/Tampa rout and don't they know it. I fly this about every six weeks or so normally in Club World but sometimes in Premium just due to the huge price variance. The quality of the planes on this route but more importantly the service and staff attitude are way below the standard you would expect and this trip was no exception. Old plane miserable arrogant staff and poor service. I pray every time I fly that another carrier will take up a slot at Tampa as it's a growing airport and when they do BA will definitely lose my business and I suspect many others.;Premium Economy;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;0
british-airways;Clive V Drake;United Kingdom;2014-12-22;"LHR-Washington on a 777-200. Trip got off to a good start in the BA Concorde 1st Class lounge. Nice champagne and a nice quiet ambiance which I like. The place is starting to show signs of wear and tear - with sagging seat cushions. Plane was latest 1st Class and there was only 7 passengers including my wife and I. It seemed a little larger than the 1st I travelled on a month ago on an A380. Maybe it was because of the hideous centre console (that houses he folding table) was smaller - rather than take up half the space. To start we had a small ""appetizer"" (an Amuse Bouche) which was absolutely hideous. A sort of grilled cheese with burnt bits on it and some sort of couscous. It was foul and we left the lot. Both had a langoustine starter which was ok. The mushrooms with it was wet and horrible texture to the mouth. The soup we both had was nice. My cod dish was very good. My wife said the steak two ways was ok. The braised part she did not eat. Wines all ok. Service from the FAs was fine. In terms of overall quality BA really fail consistently to deliver. As a matter of curiosity I sourced the on way price the day before we left; £5543 - one way. Its an insane price and if I paid that I would be furious as to the product I experienced. Travelling in 1st is only worth it on ""sale"" offers or Avios. We are travelling back in Club as in my experienced the slightly shorter flight home in First is not worth the money or the Avios. So disappointing. BA really are clueless when it comes to understanding ""quality"".";First Class;3.0;3.0;4.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;0

Crew not too friendly and were not seen after dinner service. Only one drink offered. Quite impressed with dinner filet of beef which I believe was from Club menu. Breakfast sadly was a cold croissant and jam. Return flight much better with attentive crew. Double dose of drink was a nice start. Again served a filet of beef from Club menu which was very good.

The one thing which places BA apart from Easyjet (I won't even mention Ryanair) is the speed of cabin service because no money changes hands.

british-airways;R Simon;Austria;2014-12-18;VIE-LHR on Nov 29 on an Airbus 320 in Economy - straightforward evening point to point flight with a mixed fleet crew. Flight departed on time and landed ahead of time in Heathrow which is a rare thing these days. No luggage to check and web check-in was working fine. Plane featured the new slim seats which are a step back in both comfort and legroom. Mixed fleet FA's were pleasant however the service was not particularly well organized. It took them quite some time for the service to start and it took more than 30 minutes to get a drink after the sandwich has been served. On the other hand the bacon sandwich was actually good and full bar service was offered. Other than the “required service” of sandwich drink and duty free the crew was pretty much in hiding mode. Service not quite up to usual BA standards. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE which this time was quite busy but not overcrowded. Lounge as such is acceptable but far from great. Still believe that BA offers one of the best economy products on the European market and flying them is in general a pleasant experience. (Oneworld Sapphire).;Economy;9.0;4.0;2.0;5.0;3.0;5.0;1

british-airways;A Chan;Australia;2014-12-18;"Flew return (LHR to LAX) on the A380. Condition of the aircraft is good as the aircraft is new. BA had first business and economy on the main deck and business premium economy and economy on the upper deck. This was good as it avoided the vast spaces which could make the cabin look like cattle class. The food service was acceptable and has not changed much (except for the smaller portion) from which I first flew with BA about 15 years ago. Service was delivered in a professional and timely manner. The downside was the seat design. BA is trying to fit a remote control video screen tray table and storage space all on the seat back. This makes the tray table and video screen far too small (back to sizes that I experienced back in the 90s). This made the travel experience felt like cattle class as the seat dimension is typical economy seat size. All other airlines have improved the travel experience by improving the economy seat design. The worst experience was on the return leg when a passenger absolutely refused to put his seat upright during the dinner service and this was after I asked him repeatedly. This resulted in my tray sloping down and the dinner tray and tray table hitting my stomach. The cabin crew just shrug me off when I asked him to ask the ""gentleman"" to put up his seat for just 10 minutes.

It was nice having the extra room and smaller cabin in Premium Economy - but the TV screen was tiny and you could tell it was just an out of date aircraft and needed updating!

british-airways;Boone Pieter;Netherlands;2014-12-18;AMS-LHR-JNB and CPT-LHR-AMS in club. 767 between Amsterdam and London is just wonderful Love the front cabin. A380 to JNB. This was a late departure. I could see - from the lounge - the A380 arrive at the stand some 30 minutes prior to boarding obviously arriving late from another destination and even though it doesn't require a lot of inside-knowledge to see that such a plane can not be 'turned around' in 60 minutes. However BA did not feel there would be a delay until it called all it's premium passengers from the lounge and had them lined up in 4 separate lanes in front of the counter then announcing a delay of 15 then 30 then 45 minutes: How to get your most appreciated customers furious never hear so many complaints on an airline even before the flight started: terrible ground management: not a good start. Upperdeck club seating is absolutely wonderful and this plane is so quiet that you can hear everything. Never realized how much snoring is going on at night first time I had to use earplugs. Food was just terrible and how BA gets away with having pepper and salt in the cheapest of the cheapest sachets just baffles me. The flight to Jo'burg was obviously done by the more senior crew who have incredible charm wit and the most entertaining sense of humor. That opposed to the 'new crew' on the way back from Cape Town. Old 747 with spacious seating all fine. Crew stressed running all the time no manners no sense of class and definitely no sense of humor. Food was slightly better on this long flight but way below any other European carrier I flew. It was my first time in club on BA I love the seat very comfortable for sleeping. There is a lack of space to put your stuff but other than that: a really nice product. BA lounges definitely stand out in the level of catering (food). Transfer at LHR T 5 was quick and easy but terminal itself is a tacky shopping mall and how - so soon after being delivered as new - half of it was blocked for remodelling.

The service was fantastic as always with BA. Cup of tea excellent and breakfast good. Toiletries bag was fine with all the items needed. Toilet a bit naff for First Class.

Not sure if worth a full fare but as a part miles ticket it was enjoyable. The return in economy was fine. Again the new seats are not comfortable - much prefer the old ones although the cabin does look very nice. In economy you were served a sandwich and drinks including beer. I fly the same route regularly in Finnair and BA is a superior service. The flight attendants did a good job. Not overly friendly but quite attentive.

On BA website PE meals advertised as being a choice of two dishes off the Business menu. We were definitely served an Economy meal for dinner which was fairly average. Breakfast before we landed in LGW consisted of a hard cold croissant with jam and fresh orange with tea/coffee. At the end of an 8 hour flight this was really disappointing and I would have been disappointed with this in Economy never mind PE. When I asked a flight attendant about this I was treated abysmally.

british-airways;Neil Balter;United States;2014-12-10;Phoenix to London - outbound a wonderful and enjoyable experience. The problem we had started on our return flight home. We boarded the plane and were disappointed to find out that we were in the old style first class. After being in the new cabin on the way out the old configuration is very run down and there was a rip in the seat. I was attempting to work but when I went to plug in my laptop battery I found that there was no adapter for me to use. Since I could no longer work I decided to put a movie on. The tiny screen in the old first class was just pathetic. The flight attendants did their absolute best to make up for the issues and I give them high marks for trying as hard as they possibly could to accommodate me. I decided to walk to the back and visit a friend who was also on the flight. You can imagine my surprise when I saw him sitting in business class with a TV screen bigger than mine a plug for his laptop and a new seat. At this point it became obvious to me that the rest of the cabin both coach and business class had been upgraded. It doesn't make sense to me. Just when we thought it could not get any worse we landed in Phoenix to face another issue. We waited 45 minutes for our bags before being told that our luggage was still in London. We've flown on this flight before and had the same issue of our luggage not being on the plane. The difference is that we were informed before landing that our baggage hadn't made it and that they would have it delivered directly to our home.

This year I travelled to Toronto on vacation and were assigned economy seats on the new Dreamliner. We chose not to upgrade seats as the Dreamliner blurb gushed about seat space. How foolish we were. At just 5'7"" and 5'4"" respectively we are not in any way shape or form giants. But the absolute honest truth is we were squashed in tight. The restricted space was possibly not so much the leg room but the seat width - but letting the table down for food/drink was snug. Outside of the seat space issue everything else was superb. Inflight entertainment equipment was familiar easy to use. Boarding in UK and Toronto was smooth and helpful ground staff were always visible and proactive in offering and helping passengers.

Two were on the A380 one on the B787 and the fourth on a refurbished B777. So they all had the new seat. I find it comfortable although never seem to get the headrest really right. The seats are narrow and on busy flights your neighbours can be rather close. At 1.83m the leg room and spacing was fine although some seats do have restrictions with the entertainment system. The 380 and 787 are very quiet which makes the toilets sound nosier should you be near them. On the upper deck of the 380 the overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate. I'm sure it was never planned for economy seating. Food ok - my special meals came as ordered. Flights on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant.

We made the reservation many months ago attempted several times to select seats and were told we could not do so in advance but needed to wait until we got to the airport. This was our first time flying with them and every other airline we have ever flown has allowed us to sit together. It is usually assumed that if we are married and making the reservation together at the same time using one credit card and paying a lot for the trip that we actually want to sit next to each other. When we tried to change our seats to be together all representatives said being separated was typical.

Security marred by a family carrying unrevealed bottles and liquids that was a field day for the security staff and simply a pain for the rest of us queuing behind them. The Cyprus airways lounge whilst much better than its predecessor is still third rate with a poor selection of food and wine and on this occasion overcrowded. Wandered to the gate in good time for boarding to be confronted by a flotilla of wheelchair-bound passengers all of whom get ultra priority boarding. So boarding took longer despite the fact that whilst Business class was almost full economy wasn't. On-board service was ok. Hot towels no menus drinks and a 3 course meal salad main dessert or cheese but somehow the service was not as impressive as my outbound.

I found the seat very comfortable and while it is slightly narrower than others it has a lot of flexibility with the foot stool and the reclining options. The backward/forward facing seats is not ideal although did not upset me as much as others. As I was travelling with a friend the potentially awkward intimacy was not an issue. IFE was excellent with a large good quality screen and an extensive library of films and TV. Food was fairly disappointing possibly hindered by an hour delay on departure although really they should be resilient to that. Drinks and service were both very good British Airways offer a very efficient and professional service although it is not always overtly friendly. Personally I like this but it could be seen as a negative depending on peoples expectations. Galleries Lounge in LHR T5 was excellent.

Lounge in YYZ was nice pre-flight dinner was just about OK with modest quality wines offered. Chose an Aisle seat YYZ-LHR bad idea. Seats are incredibly narrow not quite wide enough for my shoulders. Tried to sleep but not possible with in-flight staff constantly leaning across me lowering the partition and speaking to the Window Seat passenger who appeared to be a BA staff member who was determined to drink all night. Didn't eat dinner but breakfast was adequate. Decided on a window seat for the return LHR-YYZ. Bad idea again! Very claustrophobic. During the entire flight I managed to get one small glass of champagne it was very good. Thereafter no matter how many times I pressed my call button no one came thus nothing more to drink other than a glass of red wine with my dinner. No offers of cognac or liqueurs. Dinner ingredients were clearly good and well chosen but everything was so overcooked it was inedible. When I say over-cooked I mean grey vegetables that disintegrated on your fork and meat that was so dry and stringy that it was actually really unpleasant. Hadn't flown BA for a number of years and being a Brit thought it would be a pleasant change from Air Canada on this route. It was a change but not a pleasant one. It's back to AC for me. Their business class is way better than this experience. Perhaps I was just unfortunate. On the plus side the aircraft was immaculately clean clearly quite new and the inbound flight was spot on time.;Business Class;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;3.0;2.0;0

british-airways;Business;Thailand;2014-11-25;HKG-LHR-Bergen: Stockholm-LHR-HKG - A380 on long haul/A319 for short haul. I always like the forward Club cabin on BA's A380 Upper Deck despite the 7-across seating making it seem a bit cramped. Short delay to outward sector due to technical problems some of which had not been ironed out on take off. The screen dividers IFE and then the seat reclines had problems and required resetting. It was an hour before these were sorted out. My main concern on long-haul is merely sleep. The Qantas lounge in HKG is excellent and so no need to have dinner in flight. Also skipped breakfast as there is an excellent one in the Arrivals lounge. With BA having cancelled the morning flight to Bergen about 5 months after I booked my ticket I was stuck with a lengthy 12-hour connection. En route to Bergen the service for just 10 Club passengers was poor - way below expectations. With only 12 meals boarded of which 6 were a fish curry that no-one wanted (curry on a Norway flight?) 4 of us were stuck with sandwiches from the back. No tea or coffee service unless specifically requested. Return to LHR from Stockholm was a huge improvement. Friendly service quick drinks service and tasty lunch. Slept most of the way back to HKG again deciding not to eat or watch any IFE. In that respect the flight was excellent.;Business Class;7.0;4.0;3.0;2.0;4.0;3.0;1
british-airways;John Geoffrey Pierson;United States;2014-11-25;"NBO-LHR Club world and LHR-BOS in economy: generally a pleasant and comfortable experience. I have difficulty reconciling our positive experiences with the negative comments about flight attendants in other posts here. As we boarded in Nairobi the purser welcomed us by name and said how pleased they were to have us back again on BA. Before take-off from London a flight attendant offered the third person in our row a different seat leaving my wife and me with a vacant seat between us. In all cases attendants were helpful cheerful and efficient. Obviously in Club World staff have more time to spend with passengers. With the exception of the late night dinner out of Nairobi we were impressed with the meal selection and quality. Flights were on time; checked baggage arrived in good condition. Agree that having to pay to reserve seats (if you are not of sufficient One World status) is disappointing.

I flew YVR-LHR as the final sector of a round- the-world trip and I have to say I will not be in a hurry to repeat the experience. The 747-436 looked tired and ready for a refit or the breakers yard. The seat was the most uncomfortable economy seat I have ever sat in despite the headrest 'wings' which are a nice feature. The lower part of the seat backs are fibre not hard plastic enabling the passenger behind to put their knees into the small of your back. this happened frequently throughout our bumpy flight. The cabin service was lacklustre and the breakfast unappetizing. Its a shame that our national carrier has such a mediocre product compared with Emirates or Air NZ.

Not until I got to the payment stage did I realise that of the 4 flights only one short flight to Madrid was actually on a BA plane. The others were with Iberia Airways. I understand that flight operators have to partner with other agencies but you would expect then that they would adhere to standards expected of the original operator. Standards were very poor. No inflight entertainment on a 12 and 13 hour flight. Poor food and on the last leg of the journey we were even expected to pay for our food. What is this a budget airline at full blown prices?

The ambience of the cabin was very calming and soothing and the service from the young crew members enthusiastic pleasant and courteous. Managed to sleep 6 hours made the 13 hour shorter. Food was delicious and water runs in between meals very helpful to keep us hydrated. Compared to Air France which is self service appreciated that BA crew does the water runs. One complaint is the entertainment system which featured touch screen did not work on my seat but small matter. Overall a very relaxing soothing pleasant smooth flight made the 13 hours fly by quickly.

Food and drinks service speedy an improvement on a year ago when the A380 entered service and lunch took 3 hours start to end! Opted for lower deck front row middle two seats -perfect for friends not so much for strangers. Prefer lower deck on outbound due to the middle seats and high ceilings / wide aisles. Feels very spacious. Arrival at LAX improved and staff were very pro active in splitting ESTA and non and passengers and getting people through as quickly as possible. Return flight outstanding. First lounge not yet open however used Business Lounge and was quiet with excellent service. Priority boarding and walked to seat. CSM introduced himself and explained that only 8 out 14 seats booked (rarity on this route) and as such had two seats each! Middle seats for dining and sleeping then moved back to windows for breakfast and landing. Food and service very attentive – never a wait for anything had to start turning down drinks. Washbags had not been loaded at Heathrow and sleeping suit size not available but given Club washbag and as a gesture the crew gave a bottle of Grand Siecle to take away – worth far more than a couple of wash bags!

Menu is the same as economy even though they advertise that catering includes a business class entree. Catering out of LHR was absolutely atrocious - almost like a TV dinner which is strange as this is their main hub. Return in Club world was a decent product. Lounge had hot breakfast and was quite big and food onboard was reasonable. Second meal service (high tea) was a joke with pre-packaged sandwiches - not too classy.

British Airways has invented ""High Density Business Class"" or ""Sardines Business Class"". 8 abreast on the main deck and 7 abreast on the upper deck this cabin configuration is very strange. To be fair the seat itself is comfortable enough to be able to sleep but it is so narrow that you have almost nothing to store any belongings. You are facing your neighbour and if you seat on a middle seat the access to the aisle is not easy at all. You have no view outside except if you have a window seat. You have the impression of flying in a submarine! On the other hand if you are a little bit claustrophobic fly the competitors.

I did not pay $8500 to be insulted by cabin crew. Food over the four flights was inconsistent ranging from tasty to inedible. IFE showed the same movies on all four flights despite the fact that I flew in two different markets and my return was a full month after outbound flight. As I am only 5'3"" tall the seat was more than adequate though I could see how taller people would have a problem with it. Also I find it ridiculous that you must pay to choose your seat more than 24 hours before flight.

Outbound we had the 787 which is a nice plane to travel on when in Club World. It was definitely helped by the fact that the cabin was only 40% full. I was surprised that they had only loaded one of the cold options as a main meal. Not what you would expect from a full service airline. On the return from Mumbai flew on a 777 which is showing its age. The crew were very distant and far from warm. The hot dish for breakfast (a frittata) was tasteless and given that this was the main meal for the flight (due to time of departure) was disappointing. I agree with previous reports that the more experienced crew are more distant and lacking in customer service when compared with the newer crew. Based on my flying experience over the past few years I would prefer to fly with the mixed fleet crew. They are definitely more approachable. Overall flights were fine and on time.

british-airways;Clive V Drake;United Kingdom;2014-11-17;"LAX/LHR. The flight started badly with the lounge facilities (or lack of) at LAX. There is no First Class lounge anymore – and worst still its a communal Business/First facility shared by BA Qantas and Cathay Pacific. Two hours before my flight it was a zoo. Rammed with around 300 passengers from 3 flights. The food and beverages was to a very high standard. There was no separated boarding lines for First passengers. Flight left on time and dinner was an ordinary affair. A poached salmon starter was neither here or there. Luke warm soup. A rather nice but not exceptional Italian style chicken dish. All served with cheap canteen style cutlery - long gone is the nice silver-plated cutlery they used to offer. Wines were fine. Turn down bed service reminded me of why I don't like the new BA First class seat. The silliest aspect has to be that you either have a seat or a bed – and no adjustable foot rest. In bed mode and mainly thanks to the design of the centre console housing the table - the bed is to narrow. I am 6 4” tall and not overweight. It's very awkward and uncomfortable. BA in old first I am sure use to give you a foldable mattress – now they don't. You get a thin duvet. This makes the bed incredible hard; and during turbulence its a hard uncomfortable to ride. I don't think I slept more than an hour in the whole flight. The tight confines of the compartment means you have to be a gymnast to get in and out when in bed mode. This fare is sometimes as much as £7000 – one way and it's not worth it. What amazes me in the competitive world that BA operate is that they don't seem to look at the competition. They trumpet they are the best and yet they are not. Mind you on the LAX route the only alternative is AA – and they have little ideas on quality in First Class. When I look at what SIA Emirates (the best in my view) and Etihad offer BA do not come close. BA often charge more than anyone else for a frequently inferior product. In fact over the last ten years the prices have sky-rocketed and the quality and standards have sky rocketed as well - downwards!";First Class;2.0;1.0;4.0;2.0;2.0;2.0;0

Flight one hour late which meant no queues in Barbados. Overall a very good flight with an incredibly good value for money (tickets were purchased during the BA sale).

british-airways;Ross Kelly;United Arab Emirates;2014-11-11;I flew from MIA-LHR-DXB. The 747 like most of their crew is well passed its sell by date. The business cabin is tired and worn IFE below standard seats are ok but nothing great. My biggest gripe were the crew on the second leg. We were in upper deck and found them quite inattentive and everything felt like a hassle but the best was to come. My wife and I had a sleep after dinner when we woke 2 hours before arrival we decided to have a drink. I pressed the call bell and ordered a baileys and a glass of wine. I was first told that the bar had closed which was nonsense after I complained they sent down a supervisor where a long argument presumed in which they basically told myself and my wife we were too intoxicated to have anymore drink! The way they spoke to us was both condescending and humiliating and after all of this on clearly seeing we were nowhere near intoxicated they served us another drink. As a seasoned traveler I have never been spoken to like this before. We flew American in Business on the way to MIA and in stark contrast the business cabin was excellent on the new 777-300 and the crew were only too happy to serve you. BA really need to have a look at themselves your crew by large seem to have an attitude problem see the paying passenger as an inconvenience rather they a valued customer. With such choice from Dubai I will never travel BA again. If you want to pay thousands for a worn out badly designed seat to be insulted by crew who will go out of there way not to serve you book BA otherwise do yourself a favour and go with an airline that doesn't employ over unionised staff that take pleasure in being rude to passengers.;Business Class;2.0;3.0;1.0;2.0;2.0;2.0;0

Boarding pretty quick on a packed flight. I found the crew seating and PTV to be consistent and very good. Flight left more or less on time and landed 30 min early at T5 bags seemed to take ages coming off but a pretty good flight. I don't know what has happened to BA's food offering in WT+ but it has gone down hill recently the 2nd meal wasn't worth serving otherwise good service on a very nice aircraft.;Premium Economy;8.0;5.0;5.0;2.0;5.0;5.0;1
british-airways;L Goddard;United Kingdom;2014-11-06;Travelled from Gatwick to Orlando on the 24th October with BA and I was very disappointed. For a full service airline the service was no better than a budget carrier. We were travelling with 3 children in our party of 11 and were seated at the rear of the plane. Both there and back the kids meals had run out by the time they reached us as had the edible options of adult meals. The cabin was hot which made for 2 very uncomfortable flights. We had to go and fetch our own complimentary drinks and snacks which my daughter did because she was so hungry - had she not gone we wouldn't even of been aware that they were available. Lesson learned - never fly BA again.;Economy;5.0;3.0;3.0;1.0;3.0;2.0;0
british-airways;Rob Jones;United Kingdom;2014-11-06;LGW to Cancun - flew with BA in CW. The galleries lounge at Gatwick offers a terrible service - food normally consists of poorly made sandwiches pasta and other non discript offerings! Priority boarding was announced for those travelling in CW unfortunately this was not managed and it just turned into a free for all. The crew were friendly and offered a good service. BA's club product is now very dated and they need to look at ways to improve the comfort and inflight service. The so called CW pantry is laughable soggy inedible wraps pasta served in plastic containers crisps and small chocolate bars is not acceptable in this day and age. The inflight meal was adequate but not memorable the afternoon tea was somewhat better but no care went into it's presentation the sandwiches were left in their plastic wrapping which was disappointing. The return flight was awful the crew were miserable and clearly didn't want to be there. One member of the crew was very rude to an elderly lady who was clearly having issues adjusting the seat and dared to ask for help. The meal just awful dry bland and totally inedible. The breakfast served prior to landing at Gatwick consisted of a bacon roll which was vile the bread roll was rock hard and should not have been served. Very poor flight which was made worse but a very inattentive and miserable crew.;Business Class;3.0;2.0;1.0;1.0;4.0;3.0;0

Meals and drinks absolutely fine - no complaints at all. Lovely lounge at TXL small but more than made up for by the local staff in the lounge. Check in at TXL was a bit chaotic as there is hardly any space for waiting passengers. NCE-LHR on 30 August 2014. Flight left late missed landing slot and had to circle resulting in a missed connection at LHR to DXB. LHR-DXB on 31 August 2014. BA ground service was exemplary. Re- booked us on next day's flight. We had to stay overnight near LHR - refunded by BA. Baggage did not reach us in DXB until day of departure (not BA's fault) but BA refunded costs of essential replacement clothing. Flight was great ditto service from cabin crew. One member of ground crew at boarding was a bit 'short' with us but he had been given a rough time by a couple of recalcitrant Y passengers trying to board with F and J passengers.

Arrived at Gatwick and was greeted at the check in counter by a friendly member of BA ground staff our bags were taken and we proceeded toward fast track security this was effortless and after a few minutes we were in the BA galleries lounge. I find that the BA lounge at Gatwick offers a very poor service early in the morning all you are likely to get food wise is warm toast pastries and condiments! The flight boarded on time and priority was given to those flying in the premium cabin I proceeded onto the plane and was greated by the purser who showed me to my seat and took my coat. After take off the inflight service consisted of a hot English breakfast which was very nice followed by tea/coffee - this is an early flight so no other drink service was offered however the purser did ask each passenger individually if they would like anything from the bar. Very friendly and attentive crew who addressed each passenger by their name which was a nice touch. The return flight to Heathrow was also very good the lounge at Alicante is typical of those in Spain rows of uncomfortable seating with inedible food offerings! Again another uneventful boarding process the purser on this flight was very attentive and spoke to everyone individually the meal tasted delicious chicken curry and rice. All in all BA offer a good Club Europe service they are trying to cut back and this often shows they need to consider upgrading their product or risk losing out to the likes of Easyjet or Ryanair.;Business Class;8.0;2.0;5.0;4.0;2.0;4.0;1

Cabin full so crew although quite experienced busy food options were gone fast and service not that great as in the past. Ran out of champagne. Food not good at all.

Return again same experience although a 777 good check in and security fast track - lounge ok with option to dine before flying which I took in case food was same disaster as flight in.

british-airways;V Carrapiett;United Kingdom;2014-11-03;We travelled economy from Manchester to Toronto via Heathrow The flight from Manchester to Heathrow and return was very good. The seats had plenty of room and it was easy to fit laptop size briefcases under the seat in front and still have room to stretch your legs. The service from the cabin crew was excellent. The leg from Heathrow to Toronto was not as comfortable but it was acceptable. The seats appeared narrower and my case only just fit under the seat leaving little room to stretch my legs. Whilst the cabin crew forgot requests for drinks they apologised and were very friendly and helpful in other aspects. Unfortunately BA were let down by the attendants on the return leg from Toronto to Heathrow. Whilst the aircraft appeared newer and more comfortable I have never experienced such surly behaviour from the cabin crew. We had seen attendants in the opposite aisle offering passengers water from trays they were carrying but the attendants down our aisle did not do this. The lady in the seat next to me asked for a glass of water before take off. The steward was quite off hand and said he would bring her one in a minute. He did not do this and when she asked again she was told in a very rude manner that take off procedures took priority otherwise non of us were going anywhere. Even after take off she had to ask again. When they served dinner my daughter did not want a meal but she asked if she could just have the bottle of water that was served with it. The steward said that if she did not want the meal she could not have the water but that he would bring her some in a glass later. This had not appeared by the time I had finished eating my meal so I gave her the bottle from mine (My daughter has a medical condition that requires her to drink water frequently throughout the day) Shortly before landing we were served a muffin and a drink. The passengers on the other aisle were served about 15 mins earlier and they were handed paper napkins and cutlery whilst when we were served we were simply handed the muffin wrapped in cellophane but no plate or napkin to catch the crumbs. I asked for a glass of orange and a tea (as I had not drunk anything on the 6 hour flight). The attendant scowled at me and then gave me half a glass of orange and half a cup of tea (which was cold|) I did not see the attendants down our aisle smile at a customer once throughout the whole journey.;Economy;4.0;4.0;2.0;2.0;2.0;4.0;0
british-airways;S Tilton;United Kingdom;2014-11-03;Flight LGW to TFS in Business. Like another reviewer found the new business cabin to be 'sardine class'. Seats now thin and uncomfortable especially for a four hour short-haul narrower and with materially less leg-room than before the same as economy. Now it is not possible to read a newspaper without turning at an angle to the middle seat and is impossible to work at a laptop as there is simply not enough room. One wants to like and use BA but this really is hit wicket in the club cabin.

Well to be honest I was disappointed - I was at least expecting to be able to charge a phone onboard only to be told only in business class. Most other airlines have this facility in economy. No menus for food and 2 options and same with breakfast. Drinks were limited to soft and only wine and beer. Inflight entertainment was poor at best and was bored witless with films I have seen before or had no interest in. Even the documentaries were all BBC which were ok. Music was equally lacklustre and limited. Only saving grace was the seat I was in and that was the only positive aspect despite the fact there was a baby crying most of the time. Sorry BA.

british-airways;Dhaliwal Amarjit;United Kingdom;2014-11-03;BA275/274 LHR to Las Vegas return in economy. Both ways on 747-400 aircraft both times aircraft were tired and in need of updating/repairs. On the outbound flight bits of foam fillers hanging down on bulkhead wall. On return window blind broken/stuck. Also on both aircraft the IFE needed to be re-booted shortly after take-off and was very ancient compared to other airlines. Both aircraft's were very warm before engine start. The outbound plane cooled down but the return remained uncomfortably warm - opening airvents had little effect. Very rowdy passengers on outbound flight but no action taken by the crew other than to stop serving drinks to the whole cabin for a period. On return flight crew seemed in a hurry to complete dinner service - hardly allowing enough time to eat food before returning to collect trays. Food was good on both flights. Overall the flights were on time and the seats were comfortable (but difficult to get out of if the one in front was reclined). The service was functional but not particularly warm or friendly.

I am a frequent business traveller to LAX and if I had the choice I would rather be on the upper deck of the 747. The seats and small storage drawer (if you are on the aisle) feel cheap. Service levels seem to be dropping in terms of drinks before dinner (1 instead of 2) and no attention to top up during the meal. My main course of fish was inedible due to being overcooked. The staff seem grumpy about the smaller galley size (can't blame them). We flew First on the outbound to LAX which of course was better although the cabin feels quite sterile.

The outbound flight in economy a week earlier had been great food and entertainment was good staff very pleasant but it was a bit of a tight squeeze in the seats I think a 2-3-2 configuration would work a bit better. I arrived at Pearson Airport Terminal 3 booked to return to London in World Traveller Plus. Visited the Premium Plaza Lounge nice and comfy but nothing special. Boarding was really rather chaotic but I was delighted to be upgraded to Business Class at the gate! Seat 3F was a good aisle seat very comfortable spacious plenty of storage space and close to the toilets which I find more useful than bothersome there was never any queue to use them that could've disturbed me. Cabin crew were superb and attentive always addressing by name and happy to help with any queries and requests. The drinks service and the quality of the food was excellent beef tenderloin followed by lemon tart and well presented. Whilst I generally struggle to sleep on flights I found the flat bed very comfortable indeed especially with the mood lighting on this night flight. Breakfast a fruit salad and selection of pastries was again very pleasant to start the morning. On time departure and arrival from Gate C66 at T5 through border control and luggage collected took just 25 minutes.

british-airways;Garreth Elston;Canada;2014-10-28;Flew BA from Toronto to New Delhi via London in Premium Economy class in August. First leg was on a 787 plane was nice but definitely does not have nearly enough toilets on board. Premium Economy passengers have quite a walk to the nearest lavatory (bad bad design). On board service was very good staff were great food was good. Next leg from London to New Delhi was on a 777 much better in my opinion that the Dreamliner primarily as it has better toilet facilities. Again staff and service were top notch. Our return trip in October was made with our newborn baby. If anything the service was even better than on our first leg. Thankfully we had a 777 on both legs and not the Dreamliner. Staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating making a fuss about the baby and really always there to help. Again the food and beverage service was very good. The seat reclining buttons were a bit stiff but other than that the seats were OK not excellent but definitely comfortable enough. Considering that I hadn't flown BA for over ten years before these flights (due to bad service) I was really pleasantly surprised by the improved level of service provided by the airline. Yes being in Premium Economy helped but I was very satisfied comparing it to Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy which I have regularly used.

I was also pleased to get a blanket and headphones (though I had my own). US carriers don't give squat to economy passengers and I was delighted. Service was the quickest most efficient I've ever seen on an airplane. Loved the entertainment system. Even the boarding process was seriously well organized with separate lines and doors for each section of the plane. This was about as painless as it could possibly have been.

british-airways;DesBrisay Marlyn;Canada;2014-10-28;Flight 103 on October 14. We flew from London to Calgary Alberta - a long cramped ride. It was on the new Dreamliner with very tight seats the people in front had to raise their seats when lunch was served as the trays hit our stomachs! Service almost non-existent even on a 9 hour trip! Beverages served once and then at dinner the cart with wine got two rows before us (row35) and they quickly returned it to the back as they felt they were late with the coffee didn't even ask us whether we would like anything. When the coffee did come it was lukewarm. There was not one good thing about our flight. We will never travel British Airways again.;Economy;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;2.0;1.0;0
british-airways;M Bockstruck;United States;2014-10-28;"Traveled with British Airways ORD-LHR last month World Traveller on the way out and Club World on the return. Connected to DSM via American Airlines and could see a marked difference in the level of service as well as the hard product. Flew on a B777 both ways and was impressed with the amount of room both in economy and business. USB ports 1 in economy and 2 in business and large entertainment screens. The food in economy was better than I have had on domestic (US) first class and the pitch was comfortable for my 6'1"" frame. Attentive cabin staff who made sure I was comfortable. Drink service in Club world was excellent a good Rose Cointreau and Tanqueray. Lie flat bed fairly comfortable and was able to sleep for 3-4 hours. Due to changes in travel plans I had to pay a change ticket fee but even with that and the cost to upgrade to Club World I felt that I got more than my money's worth. 1 free checked bag for World Traveller and then 3 free with Club World made navigating the airport a breeze.

british-airways;Suhail Shafi;United States;2014-10-22;I recently flew on British Airways long haul on a flight from Philadelphia to New Delhi havinh not having travelled with British Airway for around a decade. I had been a huge fan of British Airways in the past and was very curious to see how their inflight product and entertainment had changed in that time. I also was curious to see Heathrow's new Terminal 5. British Airway's overall product has improved in that time. On the first leg from Philadelphia to London I was very happy to notice the new seats with excellent comfort with adjustable headrests and new Audio Video on Demand (AVOD) entertainment systems. I had been travelling with noise cancelling headphones which made the experience a thoroughly enjoyable one. Inflight entertainment system is sophisticated and I enjoyed their World music section in particular. The Asian vegetarian meals was of a high standard for the most part. My only criticism in this area was that on the second meal (breakfast) we only were served a fruit platter and had to ask for the croissants everyone else were given. In addition I found the chapatis on the Delhi-London sector to be hard as rocks. Otherwise the meals were very good. Terminal 5 is a gem of an airport but the true highlight of the journey was on the London-Philadelphia sector when I had the opportunity to fly on the Dreamliner. The plane is a marvel. The windows are huge dimmable by button too. The bathrooms are larger than usual and the flight was very smooth. Additionally the legroom on the Dreamliner is impressive - an improvement on the B777. And finally a word about the cabin attendants. Their level of friendliness varies from person to person but for the most part they represent the best traditions of British hospitality - informal politeness. All in all I was happy with my BA trip and they continue to perform as one of my favourite airlines.;Economy;10.0;5.0;5.0;4.0;5.0;5.0;1

british-airways;Richard Hodges;United Kingdom;2014-10-22;LHR-IAD-LHR 29/9 and return 13/10. We booked our original flights on WTP on the A380 and B777 both fitted with the revamped World Traveller Plus - far more comfortable than the old style WTP with an infinitely better IFE system. So guess how pleased I was when BA changed the aircraft on both flights to the now very aged and decrepit B747's with the old style WTP. The 747's really should be pensioned off and replaced with A380's - they are old grimy and falling to pieces. Our B747 was filthy. The catering on the way out to Washington was not too bad - a half decent fillet steak. On the way back beef again but nowhere near as nice and a truly horrible pathetic cold hard croissant and jam that passed for breakfast. Inedible and disgraceful. Good grief BA can't you even pop them in the microwave for 10 seconds? The good points: both flights were on time and the FA's were OK. That's it. This would almost be acceptable except for the final insult - charging for choosing your seat after confirmation of the flight. This is cheap nickel and dime low cost airline stuff and not what you should expect from the nation's flag bearing airline. No other major airline that I regularly use does this - not even small ones like Bangkok Airlines or United Express. It is shameful - even our American friends who flew BA back to Chicago were dumbfounded. You expect it on Ryanair or other low cost outfits but this really shouldn't happen on your national airline. I recommend BA but with enormous reservations - try to book on the B777 or A380 and if you don't need to choose your seat before check in you'll be OK.;Premium Economy;6.0;3.0;4.0;1.0;1.0;3.0;1
british-airways;E Eriksson;Norway;2014-10-22;OSL-LHR in Business. BA has over the last few years put less priority on Oslo and SAS today has a better offering. BA is the only flag carrier in Oslo that does not offer fast track security. The Menzies ground staff are doing their best but does not have any authority to help when things go wrong. Particularly the evening flights are very often delayed due to late incoming aircraft from LHR and I have several times been an hour or more delayed and lost intercontinental flights as a result. The de-icing procedure is also much slower than on SAS. The lounge in Oslo is nice but not magnificent. BA has better service in business class than SAS with better food and free middle seat. You do however pay much more than for SAS Plus. The crew was friendly and did their best on my last flight but seemed badly trained forgot to serve bread with the meal and spent a lot of time chatting in the galley.

british-airways;S Shailes;United Kingdom;2014-10-22;"BA176 JFK to Heathrow 13 October 2014. The outward flight had been so awful so the return surely could not be any worse. How wrong I was. Arrived at business check-in at JFK terminal 7. No staff at desk. Boarding pass printed at machine but had to wait nearly twenty minutes to check luggage. Agent was rude and unhelpful. Onto the BA lounge. Sagging shabby seats and no food except crisps. On asking the receptionist where the food was I was told passengers normally use the much advertised ""pre-boarding supper"" facility. Asked when this opened and was told it was not operating. Eventually some badly cut sandwiches and lumps of cheese with crackers appeared. No hot food was available. Two hours before departure the flight was posted as four minutes late. No further information was posted. When I asked for an update thirty minutes before scheduled take-off I was told there would be an announcement shortly. Eventually a barely audible announcement came that the plane was now boarding. The departures board had not been updated so premium passengers were forced to shuffle along with those in the main cabin. Onboard after presenting my boarding pass I was given a grunted down there with no indication as to which side of the plane I was seated. On reflection late boarding may have been a blessing. I lost count of the times I was knocked by oversized and heavy hand luggage. Eventually the safety demonstration was played on the IFE system. The sound was inaudible. Surely a safety hazard. Similarly all announcements from the cockpit went unheard. We took off one hour and fifteen minutes late with no explanation given for the delay. The wine selection was very limited on the flight as was the menu two choices of main course and only one dessert - I asked if I could have the advertised ice cream snack for desert to be told there was none on board. Food was barely edible. Service was poor. The cabin crew seemed intent on throwing trays round as fast as possible. My salad was served with desert (which I did not want) on the tray. The main course was overcooked beef near raw vegetables. I was made to feel a nuisance when I asked for a second glass of wine. The narrow seat converted to a narrow and not very comfortable bed. Other carriers provide mattresses and duvets. BA seem to think a tacky blanket will do. The whole service has been downgraded to the standards I would expect in economy class. The nicieties that used to mark business flights have been lost in the pursuit of profit. Given that BA charge far more that their competitors for this route I was thoroughly disappointed.

I have had better comfort and service on low cost carriers. The seats must be the narrowest in class for any major airline. The business lounge at Heathrow is not well signed and awkwardly placed at the top of escalators. At 0830 in the morning the tables were overflowing with used crockery and waste food. When staff did appear they did a very cursory clearing job. Never once in two hours did I see any of the sticky tables being wiped down. On boarding I was neither shown to my seat nor addressed by name as I have been on other airlines. When I asked for assistance in putting my hand luggage in the overhead locker - I was told in no uncertain terms staff were not allowed to help. Again I have always had help on business flights on other airlines. In the air the level of discomfort rose as those in the inside seats were forced to jump over my out stretched legs and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seats. The level of service could not remotely be considered acceptable for the price paid.

The 'food' was a soggy half-wrap with a filling-free miniature roll - it was unacceptable on a 2hr45m flight. No choice offered by the cabin crew even though they had 3 options. The claim that their food offering is appropriate to the time of day is hogwash - we were served exactly the same thing at 10.30am on the outbound flight as at midnight on the return. Although we benefited from it on this trip BA need to change their hand luggage policy. There simply isn't space for 150+ passengers to bring 2 bags which caused a lot of angst particularly on the return trip (both flights were completely full).

Utterly useless options provided by their staff which was weighted towards a ticket refund - no use for a family holiday.

Not that comfortable. Seat back TV is same as economy namely 4"" across tiny but selection was ok and seats are fabric and didn't seem that much better than economy. Food (beef) was outstanding for aircraft food. Staff were pretty good. Aircraft on time. Return journey much the same but staff were better. Conclusion is that face to face staff great food great. But needs a modern fleet - our 747 was really aged and their world traveller plus product needs work with hindsight probably would have just travelled economy as leg room wasn't that much more.

The 2nd meal was a freezing cold croissant hardly edible. Why do they need to be chilled? Room temp would make them a bit better. The head rest was hanging off its housing when I boarded no attempt to fix by ground staff or reseat me into a working seat. The IFE screen was so tiny and had squares on it from the old fashioned touch screen technology definitely behind both Virgin and Thomson on this route.

On the outbound flight the food choice was gone before they reached the 4th row of the economy cabin meaning that myself and the rest of the cabin had to have the second choice meal - second choice for good reason. It was a truly unpleasant tray of food. The real issue is the introduction of possibly the largest entertainment equipment box in the floor space I have ever seen. It literally takes up half of the floor and prevents you from stretching both legs out. I don't know if this is exclusive to the refitted B777's but it is certainly a side effect of the new IFE and isn't there on the the older cabins. The box seems to be under every window seat on both sides of the cabin. I really don't understand what the cabin designers were thinking allowing this box to take up so much of the space that is already so precious. They could have at least rounded off the corners. It seems rushed and last minute. This means that I am now avoiding BA when booking a trip if they are operating the B777 on the desired route.

First time I have flown BA long haul and in view of the many unhappy travellers on this site - I was keen to see for myself. I can honestly say I have never experienced such a dreadful flight. Antiquated and filthy plane is an experience I would never want to make again. The seating in Business class downstairs is a disgrace I was unlucky enough to have the aisle seat 17G which turned in to a flat bed so narrow my body and I am small was over the main aisle when asleep being continuously bumped and pushed. Absolutely no privacy in this seat and every one coming out of the toilet and standing and waiting the kitchen area could see my every move. Completely unacceptable. No mattress and only a small blanket. There is nowhere to put even a pair of glasses or a bottle of water once the tray table was put up (necessary to sleep). To get to the centre seats where my husband was - a dirty plastic ‘window’ had to be slid down and hot beverages and food had to be passed across the whole time encroaching on my personal space (what there was of it.) My husband said the middle seats trapped passengers in and getting out involved stepping over people. Extremely difficult for short people. The whole design of the business class seats is very uncomfortable and seriously flawed. The food was badly presented and unappetising. The PA system from the flight deck was inaudible I could not hear the Captain in the pre flight information announcement The other issue was a very mediocre in flight entertainment system which took an hour to get going and even the flight tracking information was not available for the whole flight. They weren’t overly concerned just superficial apologies. The toilets were filthy and grimy. The floor edges and all around the basin area where bits were falling off were thick with dirty grease. I looked into the galley and that too including the floors and edges of preparation benches was full of grime. Total disgrace. The Cabin Crew seemed in a state of disorganised chaos having a great view of seeing it all from my seat. Very little contact with passengers other than rather arrogant looks all round. Needless to say I will never travel BA long haul again. They need to get on to an Emirates Airline and see how it should be done. As a regular long-haul traveller on Emirates the difference between these companies is indisputable.

british-airways;M Richards;United Kingdom;2014-10-12;I travelled to Hong Kong with British Airways from Heathrow on a 777-200 outbound and one of their new A380's on the way back both in World Traveller. It had been a long time since I had travelled with BA (18 years!) but it was one of my better flying experiences. I didn't know what to expect this time round but the seats had plenty of leg room on the 777 on the way out. I was annoyed as I was told to pull my window blind down as other people were sleeping although I had specifically asked for the window seat for a reason. However the crew were great and asked if I'd like to look out of the window by the jump seat which I did for a good few hours! Not only that the crew called the flight crew and the co-pilot walked to the back of the plane to have a chat with me and gave me a map with all the points of interest highlighted with the times we would be above them! Airlines don't have to spend any money to truly satisfy passengers. The seat on the 777 was quite comfortable and the IFE had plenty of selection. The food was good not dried out and it was tasty. All the toilets were operational and were clean. On the way back I was upstairs on the A380. The aircraft was extremely clean comfortable and the A380 was ever so quiet in all areas of the flight which really surprised me. I really loved the 'seat locker' next to my window seat which easily fitted the contents of my hand luggage. Food was good again and the crew were again amazing allowing me to visit the flight deck after the flight had safely arrived at Heathrow. Toilets were clean and tody and all operational and the IFE was good. Leg room was good. The only thing I would say is that the IFE does take up a lot of space under the seat meaning that hand luggage cannot really be stored there and it can get in the way of your feet.;Economy;9.0;4.0;5.0;4.0;5.0;5.0;1

british-airways;P Wylie;Australia;2014-10-12;Took 6 BA flights as part of a OneWorld RTW trip. JFK to Berlin via LHR then 4 days later Berlin to MAN via LHR and 6 weeks later Nice to DXB again via LHR. All flights on time all cabin crew polite attentive and thoroughly professional. Refreshments meals and drinks all appropriate for the flights and times of day. It was a pleasure to fly BA after 5 flights with AA. Just one small attitude problem with a ground agent at LHR while boarding for DXB. We were snapped at and told to wait while other passengers (presumably business class) boarded. We were not in the business class 'line' but just happened to be standing near one of the two gates where boarding passes were checked. The ground agent obviously thought that we were economy class passengers trying to board early. Overall a 99% satisfactory rating for these flights. Did not use IFE so unable to give a rating.;Business Class;9.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;1.0;5.0;1
british-airways;Mark Freyton;United Kingdom;2014-10-12;Flown 6 flights on BA recently generally satisfied though cost cutting in Business Class seems to have got out of hand. Club Kitchen snacks are shrinking with little left half way through long flights and meals and choice less. Although there are many new business class seats out there that are better BA is still acceptable especially the very private window seats. Crew usually excellent and baggage delivery consistent at terminal 5. My one complaint over these 6 flights would be that no effort is made to control the amount of hand baggage on board even on short flights boarding takes so long while stressed crew are trying to find space for large and heavy bags when some people have two or three large bags each. Two out of six flights were delayed because of this while they offloaded some bags that would not fit. Recent flights with Easyjet have not had this problem they enforce their rules so we all know where we stand.;Business Class;7.0;4.0;5.0;4.0;4.0;4.0;1
british-airways;Dick John Parfett;Mexico;2014-10-12;Without being completely detrimental to BA I Have found the airline has become tired and lacking in Customer Service from the Cabin Crew as I fly economy class at Company expense this class of traveler is viewed by the cabin staff as something to be tolerated until the end of the flight. The aircraft that I fly on from London to Mexico city are 747-400 these aircraft have obviously travelled many hundreds of thousands of air miles the seats are mostly very worn and hard a 12 to 13 hour flight leaves one with a very numb part of the anatomy toilets seats are more often than not insecure or broken. Food offered is now without a menu you get what you are given or go without from two choices the famous BA breakfast is now no more just a sandwich or a frozen roll. The inflight entertainment is often non functional and regular resetting of the system is quite normal sound quality is always very bad. My comments are not directed at just one flight or one aircraft only I have seen this deterioration over quite a few years whilst I fully appreciate economy and money saving is today's norm major airlines to my mind should think customer satisfaction at all levels not just the First class and Business class customers. I have seen other airlines achieve and maintain very high standards in today's economic world of airline travel but sadly BA seem to be trailing to an embarrassing extent.;Economy;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;0

As we are tall thought seat pitch would be same as home. Wrong. Dreadful flight in extremely cramped cabin my husband was virtually trapped by the seat in front and the only saving grace was that we had a spare seat in between us otherwise I think we would have been standing most of the way. Poor service and truly awful food if you could call it food. Wrap and small roll with nice chocolate dessert. Wrap was soggy and inedible roll dry and hardly had any filling. Only one round of drinks then tea etc with food on a flight of4.5 hours. Really smelly toilets and air conditioning poor. Aircraft old and just a bad flight experience. Took off late too!

When I checked in at Changi the check-in staff member told me the incoming flight from London was overbooked and I was downgraded to economy (against my wishes obviously). I would never have booked BA but for the premium economy offering so huge disappointment. GB75 compensation is simply not good enough.

british-airways;G Clement;United Kingdom;2014-10-12;"Route: Heathrow - Toronto First Class daytime flight. Check-in / security: The former was smooth friendly and efficient. The latter was very poor on the basis that BA make no special provision for security with F class passengers either at their own hub (Heathrow Terminal 5) or any destination. F class passengers are not escorted which I consider to be a significant shortfall when clearing immigration and boarding flights. Lounge: Flagship lounge (Concorde Room) is quiet elegant reasonably well staffed and conveniently located after security. Good food in civilised portions served in the restaurant and a good selection of wines. IFE and Amenities: The TV is fairly decent even on the refurbed 747s. Comfortable seats / beds with decent bedding and PJs. Good leg room which I notice at 6'2"". Practical sized amenity kit which is fairly well stocked. Food: Decent food and well presented. Selection is sufficient but no special options available pre-boarding. Crew: Generally affable crew who were professional. Not the fastest of service in comparison to other F products. Crew and captain introduced themselves to a number of passengers which sits between those airlines where all passengers are chatted with and those who don't. I would say BA have the right approach in that crew seem to visually assess whether a passenger looks like they would invite a social conversation - rather than imposing it anyway.";First Class;8.0;5.0;4.0;5.0;5.0;3.0;1

I know that that shortest final hop up to the north east is usually the most problematic and unpleasant so I arrived fully expecting to land at Newcastle and get home late. However yesterday morning I was wrong my flight wasn't running late it was cancelled! I had a particularly revolting encounter with one of their ""professionals"" in T5. My courtesy and understanding towards the inept individual who was there to assist delayed passengers was rewarded with the cheap nasty passive aggressive and generally dismissive attitude which is offered so frequently by BA these days. No apology or empathy just waffle and rubbish. It's just simply not good enough and a terrible reflection of what our flag carrier has become. To cut a long story short I arrived at NCL seven hours late. And no surprises my luggage was left behind at T5. But then again BA only had seven hours to transfer it onto my flight. Well done BA!

Booked flights to Salzburg for travel in September way back in April and chose the 13.45pm flight as most convenient even though more expensive. Luckily we arranged an overnight stop in Gatwick as we live in the North of England as otherwise don't know what we would have done when our flight was cancelled with notice only being given about 9.30pm the night before. We were put on the 7.15 am flight which meant being at Gatwick for 5am. This is a much cheaper flight but no partial refund is available its take it or leave it with BA. Our subsequent onward travel plans were also in disarray because of this and it was a most unpleasant and stressful start to our holiday. Having taken the trouble to complain to BA I am amazed it took 8 days to send a most unsatisfactory short response which ended with ""we hope you fly with us again to restore your confidence in our service"".

The new cabin looks very small with the new seats and I would not recommend anyone wanting to work to fly with BA now. The service was not to a good service and when taxiing you could hear passengers telling someone to turn their phone off but no crew moved to find out what was going on they were more concerned in their own conversations.

british-airways;F Klajner;Canada;2014-10-05;Flew from IST to LHR on September 29. In short an abomination for a business class flight lasting nearly 4 hours. It started with a dirty dingy cramped lounge with very limited and low-quality food and drink selection and located very far from the boarding gates. I have used the Star Alliance lounge at Ataturk Airport and it is light years ahead of the BA lounge. The plane was an ancient B767. The business class seats had little leg room or recline were packed out hard and very uncomfortable. It took 1 hour for any drink or food service to start and we were served warm champagne and a small bag of stale nuts. This was followed by a hot meal which was totally different from that described in the menu which had been handed out and this became apparent only when the food service began. There were only two choices nothing vegetarian. The crew were disengaged disinterested and dismissive. The entertainment system consisted of only several old screens suspended from the ceiling and showing the movie Godzilla which doubtless was a big hit with the 12 year olds in the audience. At the end of the flight we were given fast-track cards to speed up our passage through customs. Unfortunately only 3 of the 6 fast-track booths were open and we ended up effectively in the slow-track line. To add insult to injury this business class flight cost $200 more than that of its competitor Turkish Airlines and bore little resemblance to the business class service and cabin described on the BA website.

Some passengers had put very small bags overhead and not under seats and refused to take them down it did seem people have more carry-on than allowed. Took off on time and arrived early but this meant no stand available for 15mins. LHR-LAX on A380. Paid to get two economy seats on the upper deck together and was worth the money as no stranger next to us no moving for loo breaks etc. Aircraft excellent IFE great (games were good moving maps etc also great) crew superb food was nice (first meal very good!) and the ice lollies were a great touch but did think an extra drinks service would have been good. We were close to a galley so easy enough to go and ask for drinks which we did two/three times. Seat was good but equal space to the earlier A320. Extra bin beside seat was useful. The arm rest doesn't go all the way up which was a bit of a pain. Take off delayed by a fault on the airbridge but arrived on time - takes a while to get off due to number of people. LAS-LHR on a B747. Older aircraft and compared to the brand new A380 it showed Again paid to get two seats together which was worth it.

We were told that they would pay for the taxi (the flight was earlier and no public transport was available.) as well as for the breakfast that we were missing at our hotel. We agreed to change because we sympathized with BA representative who had a difficult job of asking people to move to a different flight and because we wanted to support British Airways. Big mistake.

The cabin crew were very attentive. The negatives was the seating and entertainment system. With the large windows the rear facing seats were a poor design. The feeling of closeness was uncomfortable. I guess the extra seat they squeeze in makes it all worth while to the airline. The amount of choices in all the video selection and the content left a lot to be desired. Return was in a 777.

We were given vouchers as compensation and thought we would at least get a glass of wine and a sandwich - but no. The vouchers were of such low value they could only be redeemed for things like a local beer crisps and chewing gum.

While the film chronicles the supposed high standards and rigorous staff selection and training the reality is altogether different.

For a new plane seat isn't very comfortable - rather hard and I prefer the old-style head rest on the 747s. Great entertainment screen. 747 seat v comfortable and softer but plane is showing its age and noisy after a 380 flight and the seat back screens smaller than many phones these days. Staff on 380 v helpful and pleasant - more functional on the CPT leg. Special meal not provided on last section of CPT leg - otherwise provided and edible. Boarding easy at LAX more chaotic with less waiting area space at Heathrow - they really didn't plan the waiting areas well at Heathrow - just too cramped and poor layout. And transferring through from section c to section a and then back to section b at Heathrow is a real pain and the shuttle was very full too so would avoid if possible.

british-airways;R Simon;Austria;2014-09-28;VIE-LHR-LIS on Sep 18 both legs on an Airbus 320 in Club Europe (Business Class) both legs on time or almost on time with an excellent crew (as most times with BA). Transfer procedures in LHR Terminal 3 were fast and friendly even the extra security checks required for all transfers at LHR (even Intra-EU) were hassle free and easy. The scheduled layover was a rather long 3 hours. BAs Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 was also comfortable with excellent drink selection and quite good food selection. I fly the VIE-LIS route regularly and surprisingly transferring at LHR is superior to most alternatives on the VIE-LIS route (especially to the more common alternatives FRA CDG and even AMS and BRU) with the possible exception of ZRH so taking BA via LHR is a really good alternative if the direct TP flight is not an option for whatever reason. The only negative I have to say that both flights featured the new BA slim seats which are really a huge step back in comfort compared to the old seating. Seats in Club Europe are economy seats with limited seat pitch and the middle seat left empty. Its just like flying with Star Alliance with their uncomfortable Recaro slim seats. Catering on the VIE-LHR was afternoon tea which is BAs weakest Club Europe service with bland sandwiches and acceptable scones. Even their Chicken Tikka sandwiches in economy are better but they have full bar service and brilliant attentive FA’s so I believe BA is still one of best options to fly within Europe. Catering on the second leg was a good prawn salad (or a chicken dish). However my luggage did not make it to LIS that day which was an unwelcome and unexpected surprise after the long layover in Heathrow. But the issue was handled well fast and friendly by Groundforce the company who does the luggage handling for BA in LIS and I received my luggage without any further hassles the next morning. Not a perfect score due BA’s new seating the delayed luggage and the VIE-LHR catering but still pretty good service. As a side note VIE airport is getting worse and worse. Long lines at security with only two of the available four lines open. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE which was overcrowded with basically not a seat available to sit down and limited food service. But at least BA uses the old terminal which is still far superior to the new skylink terminal used by Star Alliance which really is a show piece how not to design a new terminal.;Business Class;8.0;3.0;5.0;4.0;1.0;4.0;1

british-airways;A Ross;United Kingdom;2014-09-28;"JFK to LHR - Despite the image the BA TV show conveyed The Galleries Lounges at JKF is the worst run of all the BA Lounges I have visited. I have had more polite service at Macdonalds than at the desk in the Galleries. There was nothing business class or tranquil about the space. The spa was a fully booked with no appointments for two hours and ""the sorry we can't be of service today"" was more than disappointing especially given the £6K ticket price and the message was delivered with such insincerity. How can BA get it so right offering 1st Class service in London Miami Boston Seattle Hong Kong and Sydney (to name a few) and offer budget airline service with a mediocre selection of sandwiches in JFK. Boarding was a mess. They were boarding a Qantas flight at the adjacent gate and all the passengers got mixed up. We asked a BA member of ground staff where to queue and she said she did not know and it had nothing to do with her! First and Business class passengers were directed down a cul-de-sac marked fast track which came to a dead end in a sea of passengers and eventually all the premium passengers joined the line behind the economy passengers and boarded last. We ask ""why"" as the lady gave us back our boarding cards and she said ""nothing to do with me"". Upstairs on the 747 in Club was excellent professional attentive staff good food and wine good entertainment BA at its best the only flaw was no menu cards because of a mistake at JFK no surprise. Heathrow ground services were smooth and our bags arrived in no time at all. I will fly BA Clubworld again but not to JKF I will use Virgin who offer better ground services at JFK which match the price of the ticket and they value their customer more.";Business Class;9.0;5.0;5.0;4.0;4.0;3.0;1

(Last year I flew Stuttgart and Berlin in Club for about££600 and was very happy). Firstly the flight ran from T1 at LHR. T5 Club lounge is rather good. On first sight the T1 lounge looked OK. I arrived at 15.03 and was told hot food was not available after 3pm. With a bit of grovelling I managed to get a plate of Singapore Chicken curry from the waitress. The whole food area consisted of a few miserable sandwich's peanuts and a miserable looking soup. Drinks ok. Flight was an A319 which left about 40 minutes late. Couldn't be bothered to eat the Prawn salad - which actually looked ok. FA's were fine. In summary a real big BA con. Flight was one hour and at £450+ per hour it costs more than a 7 hour flight in First to JFK. A miserable experience.;Business Class;1.0;3.0;3.0;3.0;1.0;1.0;0
british-airways;Driscoll Peter;United Kingdom;2014-09-28;"LGW to Alicante out on 8th September early flight. I was disappointed that due to BA changing the aircraft the seat in the exit row that I booked and paid extra for was not available and they had failed to inform me. The seat allocated on the Boeing was quite cramped for my frame and I was not that comfortable. I had tried to get this changed before the flight on line but all I got was a request to phone BA after the flight. There must have been other passengers affected in this change. That said the flight left on time and the proffered cheese croissant and coffee were fine. Staff attentive and pleasant. The return on 22nd was the 16.35 departure which again was punctual and my seat choice was as I had requested. The snack was fine and the small bottle of Pinotage was pleasant enough. Due to turbulence about which we had been kept informed by frequent announcements by the first officer and captain the ride was a bit bumpy for half an hour or so. I think that BA needs to update some of these old dinosaurs and invest in new planes like Easyjet and Ryanair seem to be able to do. However by booking early I got a great price decent luggage allowance and a snack so I can't complain. I also like the ability to carry on a laptop as well as a cabin bag avoiding some of the boarding horror stories associated with the budget airlines. I do like to ""fly the flag"" and shall continue to do so but a bit of investment in new planes would be nice.";Economy;7.0;3.0;4.0;3.0;1.0;4.0;1
british-airways;Paul le Grys;United Kingdom;2014-09-24;"2 recent flights LHR to SFO (12 hrs) - 7th Sept then San Diego to LHR (9 hrs) 21st Sept BA 272. Club World cabin. Wife and I have flown business class on - Singapore Air New Zealand Emirates Air Malaysia and Virgin on 20 occasions to New Zealand by various routes so we are familiar with the service provided at this level by other airlines. BA in our opinion doesn't come close. Briefly: - being charged £284 extra to reserve seats how do they get away with it? Personally we felt uncomfortable with the back-to-front seat layout too enclosed and awkward to get out of (we were in the inner cell) and I would imagine irritating for the outside passengers as well to have people clambering over their legs. Details - ""hot towels"" threadbare scraps of cloth that were stone cold in under ten seconds and then only one and nothing for morning wake-up cheap looking menus lukewarm tea and coffee thrust over the barrier in mugs a sudden rattle as the screen was lowered and a basket of bread rolls thrust under your nose having to reach out sideways to receive meals embarrassment at disturbing the outside passenger trays passed over them minute napkins (expect paper sheets anytime soon) cabin crew just doing their job walking up and down the aisles at great speeds so as to avoid being asked for something cold soggy croissants which are an insult to croissants and don't get me started about the bacon roll! We were offered a drink before dinner and had to ask for a top-up one glass of wine with dinner (dry tough steak) and a refill after we had finished eating no after dinner drinks were offered. Lights out-see you in the morning! I could go on but suffice to say we are so disappointed that our national airline could be so far behind the others.";Business Class;2.0;4.0;2.0;1.0;1.0;2.0;0

Usual assortment of cereals and fruit etc but limited selection of hot food (although the bacon roll was delicious). As is usually the case had to ask for champagne but staff happy to oblige and quickly brought it to our table. Plenty of staff around and the whole lounge appeared to be kept tidy and clean. Had to board via a bus and there was no preference given to business passengers. Managed to get onto the bus first and got to seat without any problem. Plane had been refitted with the new layout. Beautiful cabin and the seats are lovely but gone is the extra leg room in Club. Big disappointment. It feels quite claustrophobic and then the person in front puts their seat back. Not as nice a place to be compared to the old club section aesthetics notwithstanding. Friendly crew plenty of champagne and a surprisingly good hot breakfast of omelette mushrooms bacon and sausage with hot bread. Coffee still poor however. No IFE apart from progress maps / information on small screen from ceiling. BUD airport a disaster. No time at all to clear immigration but had to wait almost an hour for bags - priority tags didn't seem to make any difference. No aircon in bag collection and overcrowded with people waiting for bags. Very uncomfortable and unpleasant. On return the lounge BA shares at BUD is small with very limited selection of food and drinks but all quite acceptable. A short delay was posted at check in and gate changed but all in all no real problem. Priority boarding worked well. Same plane configuration on return. Excellent crew up front on return too - plenty of smiles and chat. FAs free with the booze and nuts. Food was again a surprise - I had cod with a tandoori sauce and rice with cauliflower. Very tasty.

When we went back to Heathrow I asked for help to get to my gate and I was put in a ""PEN"" with other disabled people waiting for our flights.

It was very difficult for the people in the window and middle seats to get over me I had to get up out into the aisle for them to get out. Being disabled to be up and down is hard especially in such a small space to manoeuvre ones legs. When people in front reclined it was awful. The food that was served was absolutely rubbish.

And when arriving at Heathrow the entrance to section c - where we landed - was closed so we were unable to transfer direct to the gates. Instead we had to take the transit to section a go through the long lines of security there and then go back to section c.

The meal service has also improved and now has the Club World main course served together with wine in a glass and metal cutlery and a printed menu. There is also a hot towel service and drinks served before take off but in plastic cups and non-alcoholic.

Disappointed is not the word. To start with the seating arrangement is absurd. All the others manage 1-2-1 or 2-2-2. BA manages 6 abreast in a horrible tight arrangement whereby you face your neighbour. When the hot towels were given out they were like warm rags in comparison to the other airlines. Food - ok there was a selection on the menu. However at service time I was merely passed a tray over my neighbour. On every Qatar flight you are not only addressed by your name but the table is made for you as if being in a 5* restaurant. None of this with BA. Once the appetiser and first course are consumed you hand the bowls back to the attendent who then passes your main course to you in a bowl. Shabby is not the word. After a reasonable sleep in a very narrow bed it was time for landing. With no sign of a priority immigration pass being given I asked the steward for one. He replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity. Stupidly I believed him. Upon departure at BKK no ground staff or passes. I return to the UK next week and for the first time ever I am dreading the experience. Never ever will I fly my national carrier again. Disgraceful.

Unimaginative and largely tasteless meals - the so-called English breakfast looked like it was thrown together by some greasy spoon in downtown Singapore. Trays not cleared away for a very long period of time (ploy to keep passengers in their seats?) no offer of a second cup of coffee/tea disappearance of cabin staff for much of the flight once the meals had been got out of the way (odd since there were loads around during boarding) - so for vast swathes of time passengers were left to their own devices to obtain water - many went off into the darkness in search of refreshment. Peremptory and insincere attention from cabin staff when they did show up - one had the sense that they wanted to get any kind of interaction over with as rapidly as possible so they could disappear again. IFE not at all user-friendly - the touchscreen didn't like to be touched and the range of films/programmes was limited and tired. BA should use some of the money from their exorbitant fares to send someone on a Singapore Airlines flight to learn how this service should actually be operated.

british-airways;B Motto;United Kingdom;2014-09-14;Flew VIE to LHR Club Europe fantastic crew looking after the Club Europe cabin the only let down is the new revamped Club Europe Cabin. I really do not believe what BA is saying that this is what their European Passengers want! The seat pitch has now been reduced from 34 inches to 30 inches which used to be the Charter Airlines seat pitch years ago. If the passenger in front reclines their seat it is impossible to work on your laptop as there is no room. I really am not able to justify paying the Club Europe Fare for an economy class seat which is the most uncomfortable seat I have ever say in. A number of passengers were not impressed with the new cabin and all felt badly let down by BA. British Airways used to be a class above the rest now they are just an average low cost carrier but still charge the high fares BA really need to think seriously about the Club Europe layout they have added more seats so it is all about money & not about what their passengers really want.;Business Class;1.0;1.0;5.0;5.0;1.0;1.0;0

Plenty of places to sit and relax; good selection of food and drinks with sandwiches some hot food ice cream fruit and a full bar. Priority boarding line worked well for business/status passengers. My main gripes are: old aircraft fairly surly crew and a consistent inability to monitor hand luggage (I saw several cases that were larger than the bag I checked in being forced into the overhead lockers). I was in seat 27A which as an exit row seat had plenty of leg room. Full bar service and a chicken tikka flatbread (and vegetarian equivalent) offered. Arrived at Terminal 5B.

Full meal service in both directions with cooked breakfast on the morning flight out and good choice of rice or noodle salads on return lunchtime flight which is a huge improvement on the awful sandwiches they used to serve.

Check in at Pearson was a bit delayed (only one counter open 2-3 hrs before departure although it is advised that passengers arrive that early). Premium economy cabin inside the Boeing 787 (Dreamliner) is very pleasant and the flight from Toronto to London was very comfortable. Transfer at LHR T5 takes time is something I learned on this trip. 1hr connection is for sure pushing it and you're likely to miss your onward connection with anything less than 1.5 hrs transfer time. We missed our connection to ARN (our connection was only 1hr) because of the long line ups at the transfer centre. The fact that you go through security again in LHR takes some time as well. On my way back to Toronto check in at Stockholm's Arlanda Airport was easy and very smooth. The flight to LHR went fine and I had to spend almost an hour lining up at transfer centre going through security. This is the part of the transfer that for sure takes time. After a train ride to the C gates and a fairly smooth boarding I was onboard the flight to Toronto. I had been upgraded to Business class which was pleasant. Service onboard was professional and courteous. Landing in Toronto was a bit delayed due delayed take off from Heathrow. My overall w BA was good. However transfer in LHR is probably one of the more lengthier ones in Europe I think.

The plane was very old and so were the crew tired and old. It look like they had just got the bad bunch of hostesses to manage this flight. BA was so particular before what's happened? The cabin was very hot and several times my wife asked about it and she was just ignored. The food was very quickly given out many of times people were missed. I have to ask for water a number of times. There was no genuine warmth. It was really like flying on a 3 class air lines. I'd love to fly BA and support them but this is appalling.

The seat does feel a little claustrophobic compared to the upper deck of the 747 but it's very comfortable. The service was outstanding provided by an all male crew. The food quality has improved and so has the menu choices. The entertainment system is excellent as it's the Thales version on the 787 so the screens are bigger and the picture quality is better.

If you asked for something they hadn't got on the cart you couldn't have it. Polite enough but not really interested in the passengers. Crew inbound not being disrespectful but they were older and much nicer. Nothing was too much bother. If they hadn't got it there and then they got it right away for you. Lie-flat beds comfortable enough and baggage allowance of 3 bags per passenger is great for the shopping. Food and drinks are good however I do think the food on Thomson Airways in premium is better than BA club world.

british-airways;Jim Wickham;Australia;2014-09-06;I'm regularly flying Perth-Hong Kong-London-Port of Spain these days. Perth to London is via Cathay Pacific business class which is excellent. Sadly I then have to swap to BA for London to Trinidad where 'Club World' is a euphemism for 'slum in the sky'. Cathay Pacific business class seats - 4 across the width of the aircraft. BA Club Slum - 8 across. If you're on a night flight that means tripping over people or being tripped over. Decor is abysmal service is average to poor. Seat and personal space design is lousy - but there's not much space to work with. Film choice is limited and the video screen is tiny and reminiscent of old analogue 625 lines TVs of the 80s.

This sector does not normally offer a First service so business class passengers were spread throughout the First and Club World cabins. All flights were on time and the cabin crew were excellent especially on the outward leg. Check in and baggage reclaim were smooth and efficient. The lounges at Terminal 5 are looking tired and were rather dirty when we used them. Food choice was limited although I did enjoy the hot soup. Seating in BA is dated and even BA's new First Class seat is rather disappointing when compared to even business class on carries such as Emirates or Qatar. Food is well below par both in terms of quality and quantity. I know BA is struggling to make ends meet but ultimately it has to appreciate that people paying for premium cabins expect a certain experience and the seat and food make up a major element of that experience. I guess there is little competition for BA on the north Atlantic routes but it helps to explain why their share of routes to the Far East and Australia are diminishing.;Business Class;6.0;2.0;5.0;2.0;4.0;3.0;1

Either it came up from the BA Rep. or my husband asked about an upgrade to Business Class and was told that would be an extra £300 for the return trip. As it was for a significant birthday he thought why not. Reasons why no-one should bother with this upgrade for this particular flight. 1) No separate BA lounge at either London City or Peretola Airports. 2) Faster boarding? Entirely pointless when you all have to get onto a bus to take you to the aeroplane at Florence. 3) Bigger seats and more leg room? They are small planes so the same throughout. 4) Luggage off first? No point when it takes over an hour to get through customs at Florence. 5) Better meal? Yes choice of meat or fish. Very nice but worth £75 each? The BA Rep should have told us about the lack of facilities and suggest a hotel upgrade instead. It was a perfectly pleasant flight the holiday was great but we paid an extra £300 for no reason whatsoever.;Business Class;5.0;4.0;3.0;5.0;1.0;1.0;0

The sandwiches that you get when you land are so awful that I think any frequent flyer is awfully fed up with them the crew make you feel that you are in their way and the plane is (again) horribly dirty.

The BA flight BA0209 was an old plane - the staff were great and food alright but the inflight entertainment was poor. Your own screen but no control over the films which all ran at different times. Having only flown Virgin and Singapore long haul BA rated way behind in all aspects. But that was nothing compared to the 737-300 we flew on with American Airlines from Dallas to London (BA 1531). I understand they are upgrading their fleet and I can see why having flown on the old plane we were unfortunate enough to fly on. The first 20 mins the plane stank like a toilet to the extent that the level of complaints and people standing in protest delayed take off. The inflight entertainment was a joke - a poor quality shared screen with 30 others two films and no choice. The crew were the unfriendliest I have ever encountered - no meet and greet or goodbyes. I thought booking through BA would ensure some level of quality and that they would demand a certain level of quality from their partners but unfortunately not.

Boarding went quite smoothly and the flight was full. It took about 40 minutes till we actually took off after the time we were supposed to. The seat I had wasn't comfortable the cushion was moving and the seat wasn't firm. The inflight entertainment had a limited choices of movies which was disappointing and the screens were small and sometimes were not working. Flight attendants were all women who were polite and smiling they did their best to make it a pleasurable flight. Toilets were clean. The headphones were broken and I had to ask for new ones. We landed on time. It took 15 minutes till the plane could park and then another 30 minutes to get off because as the captain informed us there was a long line at immigration and we would have to wait for them to give us the go ahead. Inside Terminal 7 there was a huge line it took 2.5 hours to finally reach an officer. This was by far the most annoying and tiring experience I have had. To land at 10.45pm and get out at 2am is just too much. I will now choose an airline that lands in a terminal which can handle large numbers of passengers more effectively.;Economy;6.0;2.0;4.0;2.0;2.0;3.0;1
british-airways;Paul Ingram;United Kingdom;2014-09-01;"Travelled as a family of four to the Maldives. Despite numerous requests many weeks in advance we didn't get seats together on the outbound journey. The plane was old and the entertainment system antiquated. This seems to be an issue on BA routes with little competition it was a similar story when we flew club to Mauritius. On that trip the entertainment system failed all together. On the return journey from Male I watched what I thought to be a three part crime drama called ""the tunnel"". Only after watching the third part did I discover that there was a fourth or more! Why? Why would you not have all the story? This experience aside many airlines have better entertainment systems in economy than the BA service in business on this route. When you are paying this kind of money to take two children business class you want good entertainment to keep them occupied. They don't need the space! Would also have been nice to sit together! Food was grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip. A ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food. There seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival. On the outbound journey I pressed the service button after 15 minutes it self cancelled. Pressed again 15 minutes later it self cancelled. I returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didn't notice me. Presumably this is why they didn't see the service request either. On the return trip service was a little chaotic and well below standards you should expect. Food was equivalently poor. This is the second BA business class trip I've taken to the Maldives and each time I have been disappointed given the cost.

Allow me to explain: The blue worn carpets padded fabric seats with stains worn out grey plastic panels with little grains of grit and dirt get into and a TFT which had the same image quality as VHS tape! The decor looks like it was directly taken out of the 1980 film Airplane! You still get the odd knock on the legs when economy passengers are boarding then plane with hand luggage as there is no private space! Staff were fine but flying business class a customer should get a wow factor - and there was none. The plastic translucent slider that divides the seats had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drinks. The toilets are exactly the same as economy except in Business class they stick a plastic flower in a glass. The food was OK but again nothing special. Normally its the little things that make the differences but with BA they need a total make over. For a flight that happens everyday from London to Delhi BA should be doing more.

The seat (2K) was reasonably private and reasonably quiet. Useful wardrobe with enough space to put various items and shoes but the seat has almost no other storage space. Things have to be left loose in the foot-well area. Footrest doubles as a buddy seat although his would be rather cramped I'd imagine. Seat itself fine and comfortable. Good enough to get reasonable sleep on a 12hr journey. Cabin lighting and temperature perfect. View of outside restricted by the angle of the seat - just when it is interesting (t/off and landing) you are strapped in and cannot see all the fun outside - the child in me I guess! Food and service excellent. The toilets - wow - a flimsy concertina door poor water supply into small bowl so not really good for brushing teeth. Middle-eastern airlines are so much better - BA really has to re-think. Overall BA First Class is equivalent to others Business class.

british-airways;Donnelly Chris;United Kingdom;2014-08-28;I flew from Singapore to Heathrow on a B747 which is certainly an ageing aircraft that showed its age. I think this is one of BA's main let-downs. The inflight entertainment was slightly disappointing. There wasn't a single movie that I fancied but then I suppose everyone has different tastes. I did listen to some music though. The service on board was generally good at least on the side of the aircraft I was on. The stewardess who served was very kind and attentive. The food was good although I got a sense that something was missing from the meal overall. It wasn't highly appealing. I also find the seats comfortable they are softer than those on Singapore Airlines. I slept very well and I'm not usually one to sleep particularly well on flights. BA can certainly improve in some aspects but overall I have found them a pleasure to travel with.;Economy;8.0;4.0;4.0;4.0;2.0;4.0;1

Everyone who checked in online had to wait in a very long line to simply have their bags tagged and sent on their way by a member of BA staff. If this is the case then please get all the counters working and clear the queue quickly. Pity the poor people who squeezed their way to the self check in and bag tagged their bags only to be told to join the same line. I can not understand how the system is supposed to be more efficient. We then had the situation of BA staff dragging people out of the line as they were going to miss their flight. Even the very nice BA staff member who did our bag tags could not explain what went wrong. Flight was delayed on boarding due to flight coming in late. No issue with boarding or the staff on board all very helpful. We have a drink and wrap which was very good.

And for about £2 K extra flight cost. Why? I would seriously consider flying to Sydney via Perth next time - longer but an experience where you arrive feeling caressed not bundled along.

In my mind that when I bought the BA tickets it would be a great flight experience based on their reputation as a 4 star airline. It turned out to be totally wrong. I used to travel with other airlines it seems that my flight experience with BA from Changi Airport to Heathrow was the worst in so many ways. Not worth money spent at all! Firstly the seat space was really small (I cant imagine those who are bigger than I am because I am a medium size person). Secondly the proportion of food served was not generous in comparison to other airlines. They only served food twice for that 12 hour long haul journey. Thirdly the service was considered moderate and it seemed like no one cared about the toilets in economy class (no one bothered to top up the toilet rolls). Lastly the inflight entertainment was so back dated. The movies selection must have been 2 years old. Flimsy earphones and outdated screens.

Three times an hour late and once two hours late this summer of the four times I was involved. Seems the summer schedule is very optimistic Check-in at Bari is hopeless always queues and 'bag drop' seems to be used by travellers with ticketing problems. Boarding is poor regularly left to wait in a hot air bridge between the gate and the plane. None of this done by BA staff but they are doing BA's reputation no good seemingly using the level of service expected with the low cost carriers that also go to London. Onboard though is always good despite the age of the planes. Fair choice of drinks and a good sandwich nice crew. My flight ended with a 50 minute wait for luggage.

Outbound flight (15/7/2014) was BA at its best. On time departure (a rarity it seems at LGW for BA) A320 in fair condition with additional leg room in Club Europe and two excellent flight attendants. The return (22/7/2014) was a different story. Probably my worst BA flight ever. Delayed departure from TFS though only about 10 minutes late in arrival at LGW. No additional leg room on this A320 in Club Europe. Lazy cabin crew who did the bare minimum with limited grace. And screaming infants out of control toddlers and ignorant teenagers in the Club Europe cabin - not the airline's fault but they could have and should have done more to manage the situation. One example - two teenagers in row 1 immediately reclined their seats into the faces of the couple in front of us after take off. The cabin crew didn't even make the teenagers raise their seats during the meal service. All credit to the couple in front of us though. They had the manners not to recline their seats into our faces. The substantial premium to fly Club Europe is just not worth it when other people's children are not controlled and the promised additional 'personal space' is not provided. Scores are an average of both flights: outbound top marks across the board (bar entertainment there was none) inbound I would have preferred to score zero.;Business Class;6.0;3.0;3.0;4.0;1.0;3.0;1
british-airways;Marie Thompson;United Kingdom;2014-08-20;18 August 2014 Gatwick to Orlando flight details and departure went well. However when the food was served on the flight there was limited choice chicken or sausages which was fine until they ran out and then could only offer the veggie option which was pasta which my Father in Law doesn't eat so he ended up with 2 bread rolls as his lunch/dinner. This was served within the first hour of our over 8 hour flight and then 7 hours later we were served a snack which only had one option coronation chicken (chicken again!) which only 2 in our party of 6 liked. Again my Father in Law had nothing as he was 1 of the 4. Pretty poor show British Airways as we travelled with Virgin to Mexico in June this year economy class and they offered a menu with three choices for lunch/dinner with enough for everyone! Again when the snack was served option were given and enough for all. Virgin also provided a very good entertainment system with up to date films TV and games which was something you need on a long journey again BA was not able to provide. BA your competitors are definitely offering more value for our money! I wouldn't not fly BA again as I don't like to limit my choices however I would definitely prefer to fly Virgin in future. In my opinion all flights should have enough food for all of their passengers and look at what they are offering as coronation chicken didn't go down well with a large number of passengers what's happened to good old ham or cheese?;Economy;7.0;3.0;3.0;1.0;1.0;2.0;0

A person has to put up the foot rest for a place to stand and then step over the person next to them to get out into the aisle. In addition the person on the window seat gets all the food handed to them in front of the face of the person on the aisle. They have put so many people in each row that the seats are very narrow.

The cabin crew were excellent though I will concede. Food was very poor with my steak ruined because it was swimming in grease (laughingly referred to as jus) which mixed with the hollandaise sauce to make a disgusting mess.

On leaving Dublin the pilot opined that it was a good day to fly! On reaching LHR we were informed that due to thunderstorms we were to be diverted to Gatwick and were running out of fuel. In summary we sat on the tarmac at Gatwick for over two hours with only scant updates as to when we would be taking off for LHR and the temperature inside the cabin became oppressive which added to the misery. On reaching LHR BA staff were in my opinion ineffectual with a 'sorry and shrug of the shoulders' and with no real assistance for those passengers on connecting flights. I was lucky as I managed to get on my flight to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific but with only moments to spare after a dash to terminal 3. Whilst I understand the volatility of the weather the real point of my review is that BA appears to have abandoned the basics of customer service and this is clearly reflected in BA's absence in the top 10 airline ratings.

I was surprised at the limited wine selection: Two whites and two reds. I had a NZ Sauv Blanc which was tasty but 'connoisseurs' may have felt restricted by choice. The staff were overall very pleasant and happy to help when asked but just weren't pro-active. Passengers (myself included) were having to ask for things that should have been attended to without request. They seemed 5 minutes too slow for drink rounds meal service etc. This is a small complaint however as I managed a solid 7 hours of sleep and the overall experience was good. The entertainment system on the A380 is much improved and is as good as any I have flown VSSG etc. The window seat is certainly more private and feels much more spacious with the storage compartments under the windows and I would recommend these - especially over middle seats.

Food almost non-existent on this 2310 departure and most people slept: this would be understandable if a proper breakfast was on offer. Unfortunately it was no better than going to McDonalds with some unripe fruit and a sort of egg and bacon muffin - just awful. Also the person in the window seat did have something to eat and drink and every time the crew member came with his orders he would lower the partition to pass them through with all the disturbance that creates.

Virgin however dictate how many points you can spend on each flight.

british-airways;Tony Laverghetta;Canada;2014-08-04;LIS-LHR on 30 July J class on an Airbus 320. I was expecting more however I was disappointed. Seat was OK but not particularly comfortable food just average with a choice of a fruit or meat platter either very poor. Cabin crew in an automatic mode no smiling whatsoever more interested in chatting in front of the cabin and complaining about not sure what. No inflight entertainment altogether not even a shared movie. However we departed on time and arrived 15 min before schedule and the price was the cheapest ever for a Business Class seat. Will fly BA again but I am more keen to Intercontinental flights where the quality is superior than European routes.;Business Class;6.0;3.0;3.0;3.0;1.0;4.0;1
british-airways;Holder Timothy;Switzerland;2014-08-02;Upgraded from Premium Economy to Business from YVR (Vancouver) to LHR (London). The Club World cabin was full and a couple of the passengers had been upgraded to First. Despite this the staff were friendly and helpful although the food wasn't that great (the chocolate desert was delicious though). Seat is nice and wide but if you're facing rearwards on the 747 you could be sitting right next to someone you don't know. The IFE had a lot of choice and had many new movies to chose from.

Boarding was like a rugby scrum with no priority boarding and then spent 20 minutes on an a bus with no air conditioning crammed packed in hot conditions. Flight had run out of food.

british-airways;Mike Palmer;Canada;2014-07-31;"Toronto to London in WTP on a 787 and London to Toronto in club world on 747. There were elements of both flights where BA seemed to be back to their old self. The Dreamliner in WTP was on time with some of the best cabin service I've experienced from a male attendant who smiled couldn't do enough and was just professional. BA seemed to have dropped some of the nice touches though so no hot towel soft drink before take off or menu cards - looks like WTP seems to have been demoted (again). Fast bar service and good entree before the WTP service morphed into WT for breakfast which has reverted to ""muffin or nuffin"" and Ts and Cs and juice from paper cups. It really is an insult after an overnight flight and is ill thought out and penny pinching. Landing early at Heathrow and fast bags ended a good overall flight. The return flight in club was one of my best ever. The lounge had a better range of hot and cold food though most of the furniture still needs replacing. On board two male crew upstairs on the jumbo were superb. Friendly helpful and starting off well with a 2nd champagne before take off due to delays in boarding. Fast bar service and an excellent lunch with the sea bass being exceptional. A calm oasis on the upper deck allowed some sleep before the now tired afternoon tea was served. Real personalised service with a smile reminded me of old times of BA at it's best. An on time landing and fast bags off finished an excellent flight. Why can't they do this more often?

Seats were comfortable but the leg space was restricted by the IFE- computer which has been installed underneath the seat in front. Amenity kit contained a cushion blanket headphones and toothbrush. There were no eye shades and ear plugs. Food both ways the same selection: Tikka Masala or macaroni and cheese of average quality followed by a small ice cream and a sandwich or breakfast croissant. FA's lacked courteousness friendliness and motivation. There was on both flights repeatedly no reaction to the call button and they were several hours not present in the cabin. IFE-system is good with a big selection of movies documentaries etc. Due to a malfunction the system had to be restarted which erased the preferences.

Value for money was a '5' because I didn't pay for the flight! Flight went well and I even managed some sleep on the fold flat bed. Cabin crew were pleasant and helpful one of the attendants retrieved his own USB adapter from his luggage so that I could charge my phone (I was a little surprised that there wasn't a USB port at my seat - upstairs 747). The same attendant appeared in the passport control hall and called out - without success unfortunately - looking for a passenger who had left his glasses behind. Food was absolutely fine and the Burgundy a little too drinkable. This was probably up there as one of the better flights I've taken - most are done under sufferance but this one was pretty good overall.;Business Class;8.0;3.0;5.0;4.0;4.0;5.0;1
british-airways;Jim McCormick;United Kingdom;2014-07-31;26th July LGW to Orlando. Drinks service from the crew was good. Champagne upon boarding and a top up without requesting. It was greatly appreciated! Food was not outstanding but pleasant enough. Overall the cabin service was good. Several services of drinks and top ups when requested. What let this flight down was the number of unruly children on this flight. I was in an outside seat on the port side and an 8 or 9 year old child in front got out of her seat every five minutes or so continually throughout the flight and her younger sibling was also jointing her when she did manage to stay put. I attempted to avail myself of the flat bed but three times these children stood on my legs as they clambered over into their seat. The parents of these children never once intervened to check their children's behaviour although they were well aware of how they were behaving. My wife did not have much luck either. The couple to her rear were sat throughout the flight crossed legged in the isle playing with their children and their toys and my wife had to struggle passed them every time she wished to use the toilet. Surely a tripping hazard! There were many other children on the flight who were well behaved so it can be done if parents set boundaries for their offspring. Whilst BA cannot be held responsible for children's behaviour I feel that as we were in the Club World cabin some sort of announcement should be made by BA requesting passengers with children respect the comfort of fellow passengers.

I sat on the upper deck which was full but this did not detract from the excellent service provided by the two dedicated crew. I chose this seat as no one has to step over your feet when they exit and it is also a fraction longer than the other seats with three windows and four compartments beneath the window to store items. I did not use the seat as a bed but used the Z position which is very good for relaxing.

The configuration is 1 and 2 seats and if you're travelling alone the single seat is great to have. There is lots of space to place items and the seat has different positions from arm chair to fully flat bed. The seat also has a built in massage function.

The lounge had plenty of not very comfortable seats and limited food and beverages. The gate area was more like a holding pen and was much too small for a 747 load. First and Club ended up boarding through a different gate number. Once on board I was shown to my seat and given an explanation about the seat functions. Service from the mature crew was excellent (there were only one other passenger in First). The food was OK but not particularly exciting. The main disappointment was the seat and amount of personal space with only enough room for shoes and a jacket in the wardrobe. Everything else had to go in the overhead locker. There seemed to be too many seats crammed into the cabin. I moved from 1K to 3K as this had a bit more space and privacy than the others.

BA shares a lounge which has a colonial style dress code so I had to nip to the loo to change from my shorts to trousers left on time for the 45min trip to St Lucia where the bulk of holidaymakers board back to LGW. I was positive as I heard the new POS-St Lucia cabin crew ask each other if they wanted a beer! They then landed in St Lucia and were busy saying goodbye to each other and the incoming new crew but not saying goodbye to the departing POS-St Lucia passengers! St Lucia-LGW with new crew. Girl came around with newspapers and I said 'FT' please which she had in her hand but she had no clue what the FT was! Did not dare ask for top up to the one glass of bubbly as it is clear as soon as the various jobs are done by various designated crew that's it. New male wash bag is a laugh so I asked for the female wash bag which actually is slightly better. Flight got very cold and I asked for an extra blanket.

My IFE did not work on the return flight. The in-flight food was above average but not outstanding. Check-in at Mumbai for the return flight was very slow. We were kept waiting for at least 40 minutes with no apology for the delay. The business class lounge at Mumbai is appalling cannot be described as business class at all. No facilities the food very poor both in quality and selection and had clearly been hanging around for some time. The whole experience of BA's Club World was seriously underwhelming and we will not fly with them again.;Business Class;3.0;2.0;2.0;2.0;1.0;1.0;0
british-airways;Payne Rob;United Kingdom;2014-07-15;LHR-CPH-LHR. Business class on the way out and economy on the return trip. Flight on time on both trips staff as usual excellent both within the airport and on the planes. No inflight entertainment at all both operated by A320's whose seats were looking just a little tired. The biggest gripe I have is the food on the business flight we had some sandwiches which were bordering on being stale and on the return trip was a cold chicken wrap which was very short on imagination. Quite disappointed that the food appears to have gone downhill badly since our last flights. Come on BA these are the sorts of things which gave you a clear lead over most of your rivals.;Business Class;6.0;3.0;5.0;2.0;1.0;3.0;1

british-airways;G Thompson;South Africa;2014-07-15;Flew JNB-LHR return. Only considered BA because they fly the A380 on the route which is undoubtedly the best aircraft to fly on. Only hit minor turbulence in both directions so one can easily get some rest. BA have undoubtedly upped their game in premium economy - the 744 equivalent was about the worst in the sky. The A380 is a considerable improvement. Only gripe is that on premium economy you get no special boarding benefits so by the time I got on the plane the cabin was already full - can only assume the others all had the relevant frequent flyer privilege. Anyway the food was superb with proper crockery and cutlery attentive service and superb entertainment. But I really only recommend flying the A380 if you are unlucky to find yourself on the old 744's expect the opposite - a cramped cabin with mediocre seats and regular economy class service.;Premium Economy;9.0;5.0;4.0;4.0;5.0;4.0;1

She had a fit to fly certificate that stated that she needed room to turn as she had recently broken her hip. I was told at the airport that there were no seats at the front available so she had to go into the second row and had to shuffle in sideways which was very painful and distressing for her. Then the 3 seats in front of her where she could have had room to turn were occupied by 3 able-bodied men! I think this is total disregard for passenger welfare.

Premium cabin is cramped and a fair distance away from the Toilets as you are not allowed to use the toilets at the front again cabin crew do no more than the minimum food just about acceptable. Return flight of the same standard they kept trying to say I was booked back to Edinburgh took them an age to sort this out breakfast is a bit of a joke have found when flying BA that its best to carry snacks as they don't over feed you. Of course when I got back to Gatwick I ran into the French ATC control strike no announcement made. After having to hang around Gatwick all day I finally got a flight to Glasgow at 8pm at least my luggage arrived well done to BA there. When I made a comment to BA customer service I was told by them that my flight(s) had been cancelled due to Aircraft unserviceability when I queried this the respondent confirmed that aircraft u/s could offer no explanation as to why I was told different.

Squeezing so many passengers into the nose of a 744 is a joke. The staff both ways were excellent and attended to the half empty cabins with great attention to detail. OB were the old contract crew and IB was a standby mixed fleet crew not normal on this route. Food from LHR was palatable and from YVR was awful. On the return leg the IFE was faulty. The fast track OB was a free for all as we were bus fed to the aircraft on return how it should be. I feel the BBC has hurt BA with First passengers having their expectations raised to abnormal levels only to be let down by an average product on very tired equipment not as shown on TV. We were generally happy due to the fact that I used Avios and an AMEX voucher for the flight if we would have paid for the flights then it would have been disappointing and would have chosen Air Canada. BA really do need to sort out their dated equipment sooner rather than later before more premium clients opt for other carriers especially on the middle eastern and far eastern routes. We will continue to use BA due to the Avios rewards which demands loyalty for financial reasons I could not recommend for passengers having to pay for either CW or First.;First Class;8.0;5.0;5.0;1.0;1.0;5.0;0

Several years ago I was put off from flying British Airways so thought I'd give them another go. Wasn't disappointed all flights were good considering we flew straight through to Rome I felt pretty good at the end of 30 hours in the air. The Premium Eco seats had plenty of leg room on all flights 2 bags per person even the flight from Barcelona to Gatwick which we were very grateful for. Can't say the food was anything to rave about. When the food you are eating has been on the plane as long as you have it really can't be good. Overall the flights were really good on time easy pickup of bags etc. the only disappointment is having to pay for the allocation of our seats. Apparently this is now common practice.

Security speed average despite Fast Track. First Class Lounge food good and the business centre worked well. Boarding efficient in Fast Track. Left the C Terminal gate on time. Staff reasonably efficient and friendly throughout the flight. The latest Elemis wash bag is a bad joke! CW food is still quite disappointing and inconsistent with the pasta meal being quite dry. Wines and beverage choice good. The eight-year old CW seat is in desperate need of a competitive replacement. Eight across in CW is pathetic. The seamless seat cushion itself is very comfortable though the foot rest does not work well when combining the two to make a bed. If reduced to six across in CW there will be more room for the storage of small items needed during the flight and much more shoulder elbow and hip room. Thankfully I did not have to jump over anyone's feet from my window seat as the aisle seat was unoccupied. Baggage was awaiting my arrival after clearing immigration at IAD. Overall a reasonably pleasant flight but it is sad to see how the BA CW product has declined so much over the past 15 years.

Once on plane saw a number of economy passengers throw their hand luggage up in the open lockers above the Club Europe passengers which we feel should be policed as the late arrivals of the Club Europe passengers had no room to put their hand luggage. Service and meals were average but really not worth the extra money especially once we got to Rome when all the Club Europe Passengers luggage was last off we waited close to 30 minutes.

My husband had requested assistance and we were told to wait until all the other passengers had disembarked (which took 20 minutes) only to have to join a bus with no help at all.

Flight completely spoilt by massive 130 kg passenger seated in middle seat - he could not fit between the armrests and needed help from both myself and passenger in aisle seat to even fasten his seatbelt. This is unacceptable especially since I paid £30 extra to choose my seat!

No drying of the eyes or popping of the ears thanks to the good air system. Although a little cramped in economy on the outbound journey I was able to secure a bulkhead seat on the overnight back. I would definitely recommend this as value for money over eco+. Just buy the economy ticket and pay to have a front row seat (there is more leg room and the same service from what I saw). The small commuter plane from ABZ to LHR and back was starting to feel pretty old and tired by comparison to the 787 however the cabin crew did a great job shoehorning in a full meal service in less than an hour.;Economy;7.0;3.0;5.0;4.0;5.0;4.0;1

On boarding I agreed to swap seats with a woman who had been seated separately from her husband. Having ordered a vegetarian meal I let one of the cabin crew know that I'd swapped seats. When the meal was served I got told off very rudely by one of the cabin crew for moving seats without telling them - even though I had. Before I could explain my meal was dumped in my lap and he flounced off. Food was ok. Cabin crew smiles were forced.

Having arrived in London on JAL after an exquisite experience in their 777 first class I had high expectations of my premiere flight in BA first. Suffice to say I won't be back. Whose idea was it to jam 14 seats into a space that quality airlines fill with 6 or 8 seats? It's crowded ugly and lacks privacy. The whole cabin - and this is 'new' first I might add - feels pretty cheap and is already showing signs of wear and tear. The seat itself is narrow and displeasing. Crew were cheerful and professional but the food would be considered business class standard on world class airlines. That sums it up really - BA is simply not offering a world-class product. I can't imagine why anyone would put down the money they charge for first class unless there was no high-profile Asian or Middle Eastern alternative available and even then I'd probably go out of my way to avoid them. I suggest that BA product managers might want to go on a world tour via Abu Dhabi Tokyo Hong Kong and Singapore and try out the competition because it's plainly evident that they either have no ideas or just don't care. There is apparently a ""new new"" first class planned for the 787-9 when it enters service with BA and I sincerely hope that both the hard and soft products will be worthy of being branded ""first class"".";First Class;5.0;3.0;4.0;2.0;2.0;3.0;0

The meal service in Euro Traveller is appalling as are the customer service standards of the New Mixed Fleet Crew The food offering was inedible a choice of Flat Bread with Chicken Tikka or a Salad. Do British Airways not understand that not everyone likes Curry or spicy food. At least do an offering of Meat or Cheese Sandwiches to make the selection a little better in consideration of the fares passengers have paid. As for the cabin crew this new Mixed Fleet with their Thunderbird Hats are very inferior compared to the cabin crew on the old contracts. At least experienced cabin crew would sort something out in the galley to at least compensate for the lack of food choice even if it is cheese and crackers. This crew do not offer anything and were nowhere to be seen once they did their meal service. I would have expected for a two hour flight they would at least walk through the cabin a few times offering more drinks etc the only time they came out was to clear away the meals which many people around me had left and not touched and to do the Duty Free. I fly British Airways every week and this is the worst crew I have known. I think the Mixed Fleet Crew are appalling in their customer service standards they can certainly learn a lot from their more experiences colleagues who are on the old contracts so come on BA start to bring back the high standards again the new Mixed Fleet Crew are letting you down very badly.;Economy;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;0

The CSD was not seen nor did he even come to speak with me even though I am GGL member. The only help I got was from one of the Hong Kong based air stewardesses who went out of her to help me. Without her help I would have missed my onwards to Jakarta. Certainly not impressed by the service. I made a follow up compliant however never received any response.;First Class;2.0;4.0;2.0;2.0;2.0;2.0;0

british-airways;V Bristow;United Kingdom;2014-06-23;Flight BA 202 Boston to Heathrow. Aircraft B747 version 1. We were seated in PE. The cabin was quiet and not full so we had plenty of room. The cabin crew were very attentive and spoke to all the passengers in our cabin. Service after take off was very quick and professional the food was very good and not hurried giving us 3.5 hours to sleep. The seats were very comfortable and the extra space was appreciated. My only complaint is my TV monitor was faulty and had a black line down the screen. It was not an issue as I was planning to sleep rather than watch a movie. The cabin was quieter than economy as it was at the front of the plane and I had a good 3 hours sleep. The Flight attendants were offering drinks throughout the flight which was good. The breakfast was a croissant in a box which I found a bit of a disappointment. Overall I would fly BA Premium Economy again.;Premium Economy;9.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;3.0;5.0;1

Cabin crew were not particularly attentive or helpful. Dinner and wine/drinks were nice although cabin crew had to be prompted to serve drinks again after dinner. Seat and space was ok although functionality on seat not as good as Emirates or Cathay. My friend had no direct access to aisle and had to jump over another passenger's legs.

When we were seated we were offered champagne and we organized our belongings quickly. I sat down got out my magazine and asked the flight attendant how to operate the light and she apologized that our seats had no power and they have been working on it. Well after about ten minutes the door closed and the plane pushed off and I inquired again about the issue and she said the pilot was working on it. The power never came on during the 10.5 hour flight. We had no lights no entertainment no seat adjustments. I not given the opportunity to deboard when they knew of this problem or to reschedule another flight. This is not how you treat your business club passenger or any passenger.

In celebratory mood as going for a 30th cabin crew outbound fantastic the drinks kept flowing and never a rolled eye or any surly attitude from the crew. Managed 4/5 hours afternoon nap. Upgraded WTP home bound to CW through AVIOS 24hrs before and even bagged upper deck. An amazing night flight left on time. Have always found UD crew fantastic two pre departure drinks and mixed fleet seemed genuinely flying to serve. Only downside was pretty terrible dinner - starter and salad dreadful steak main not much better. Requested tray be taken away and skip dessert. Reclined and slept - and got woken 6 hours later for a bacon roll. Landed at LHR on time through security four bags collected and out of airport in 25 minutes.

Fell asleep when finally got on board only to be woken an hour later to be given my ""special meal"" which I hadn't requested. Told stewardess it was not for me and she rather huffily took it away. When the trolley came round with the regular meals i was not offered one - this suited me as I don't relish eating at 1 o'clock in the morning but thought it rather petty of them to ignore me. Return flight was on time but had passenger from hell next to me who was too large for the very narrow economy seats so I spent the night sitting at an angle as it was impossible to sit straight with Mrs Large spilling over onto my seat.

british-airways;D Remnant;United Kingdom;2014-06-17;London Gatwick to Orlando. No surprises to guess that as our original flight to Tampa was cancelled this is not a good review. Due to a technical problem with our plane our flight was cancelled. After finding out from other passengers in the terminal that our flight was cancelled we were marched back through the airport to queue for our luggage to queue to go back through immigration to queue for our details to be entered onto the BA system for an unexplained reason. What an insult to have to stand in line 3 times for over 3 hours. No extra staff no positive explanations no apologies no customer service only a lie of a promise of a special flight the following day to our original destination (which did not happen) and some inadequate vouchers for food and drinks. After accepting that our flight was cancelled and then accepting the fact we would be travelling the following day BA then just drop an email to all passengers to advise them what arrangements had really been made. Our first arrangement was a flight 24 hours after our original departure time from Heathrow to Charlotte to Tampa. We did not book our direct flight by accident why on earth we would we accept a flight with a stop over. I declined this arrangement for a flight instead to Orlando. A longer busier flight a bigger busier more time consuming airport a 3 hour drive from our holiday destination. We arrived 32 hours later than our original arrival time and therefore lost a day and a half of our holiday. To add further insult on our return flight the extra leg room seats we paid £100 for not allocated to us!

british-airways;Claire Shawcross;Canada;2014-06-17;We travelled to and from Europe in business class for a two week Mediterranean cruise. We upgraded to business for the added benefit of sleep. My first impression is that the fleet is tired and not very well kept. The seats were uncomfortable the cabin was dirty and staff were surly. The food as expected on any airplane was adequate though nothing to brag about (take advantage of the scones and clotted cream - their only saving grace). Upon our return we awaited in London Heathrow Terminal 5 for them to put the gate on our flight. It finally appeared 20 minutes before the flight where it showed we were in satellite C - it took us over 15 minutes to get there to have the gate agent tell us we should have been there earlier. She did upgrade us so we thought at least that was a perk. Well I am here to tell all - don't pay the money. There is little to no difference in first class. The seats are just as uncomfortable the food was the same and I still felt like a second class citizen. This time I think it was because were an upgrade so we were always served last and with little selection/choice. To tell you the truth if I had paid for this upgrade I would have been upset as I don't believe this is up to par. We also did a connector flight from Venice to London on the Saturday. The airport was a disaster (3 cruise ships all flying out the same time) no organization from the agents and very little help. When we got on the other side of the check in the multi-million dollar duty free area was amazing but really they should have taken some of the money to deal with the check in area. Upon moving through security we were kept in the dungeon area of the airport to wait with tepid air conditioning while our flight was delayed with no explanation. When we were finally boarded we were told by the captain that the delay was due to thunderstorms and we were still going to have to wait. The last part is not fully BA's fault (they don't design the airports or determine airspace closure) however their agents did nothing to make it better either (by having people out to direct traffic or give us updates). All in all I don't believe I will ever fly BA again - this is unfortunate because they used to set the standard - now they are barely sweeping up the floor (wish they had - at least it may have been cleaner).;Business Class;2.0;1.0;1.0;2.0;3.0;1.0;0

We had monitored the outbound flight on the internet so we knew it was about an hour late although we did not receive a text from BA to confirm this. We arrived at Paphos airport to a somewhat chaotic scene as the queue for security was snaking back around the complete length of the check in area and ultimately merging with the passengers looking for and waiting to check in with a number of different airlines. BA had 3 check in counters open one of which was for Club Europe with around eight couples queuing for each one. We had checked in online but still had to drop the cases off and receive our boarding passes and this took approx 20 minutes. I then asked where the fast track through security was what a stupid question that was as as there wasn't one. After 45 minutes in the queue we finally made it to the shared lounge and settled down to a glass of wine or two. The food options were OK but again not a great choice for veggies. The flight home left around 45 minutes late and was fairly uneventful with a relaxed cabin crew. We were off the plane quickly but then had to wait for around 45 minutes for the cases to arrive on the carousel although fortunately ours soon came through. Overall just an OK flight but BA's premier European product is somewhat underwhelming.;Business Class;5.0;2.0;4.0;3.0;1.0;3.0;0

No sooner in their seats and fully reclined.

british-airways;Ian Robinson;United Kingdom;2014-06-16;LGW - Paphos 4th June. Check in and fast track security was very easy and we were airside within 5 minutes. As we were flying at 2.45 we decided to have some lunch in the lounge. The lounge was busy but there was still plenty of space to relax. The food options were poor to say the least with soup sandwiches or ham salad being the only items on offer. My wife who is a vegetarian was not impressed as she had to make do with an egg mayonnaise sandwich. Having been told when we checked in that the flight was 'bang on time' the screen informed us at 2.05 that we should proceed to gate 101. After a 10 minute stroll we arrived at the gate to be told there was a delay to the flight. Why on earth this information could not have been passed through to the lounge is a mystery. No pre flight drinks were offered and we eventually took off about an hour late. Pre lunch drinks were served after 40 minutes and then lunch about 30 minutes after that. The crew were very nice but rather stressed and mentioned that the plane (737-400) should not have been used on this route. My wife had pre ordered a veggie meal that was not loaded on the plane but the very nice but stressed FA said she could have hers. It was a nice gesture but my wife felt slightly guilty about taking it although she did and enjoyed her meal. I was told that there was only one option left for me and I could have Kedgeree or Kedgeree so that's what I had. It was OK but not particularly hot. Arrived at Paphos about 45 minutes late with our priority luggage being in the last 6 cases to arrive on the carousel. Overall the flight was just OK although if it had not been for the excellent cabin crew it would have been disappointing. My wife did receive an email from BA within 2 days of our arrival saying they had let her down with the non arrival of her pre ordered food on this flight and apologised which is fare enough.;Business Class;6.0;3.0;4.0;3.0;1.0;3.0;0

I paid £20 extra to reserve seats in the upper deck at the very back this area is only 4 rows separated by galley and toilets and really does feel like its own private cabin. Plus the seating on the upper deck in a 2-4-2 layout means sitting by the window not only feels more spacious as you only have 1 person next to you but due to the shape of the A380 you get huge amounts of shoulder room and access to little storage lockers below the window. Flew Virgin UC on my last trip to LA in a tired and dated aircraft and BA economy was welcome. Can not recommend BA enough.;Economy;10.0;4.0;5.0;3.0;5.0;4.0;1
british-airways;S Levy;United States;2014-06-09;"We just flew round trip on the new A380 from LAX to LHR (and then on to Rome). The A380 business class area was nice and the food was decent. However the layout of the seats wasn't great (you have to jump over the person next to you when they have their seat in a flat position). Also avoid the aisle seats as you feel like you're out in the open and people are constantly bustling by. As well the seats on the aisle have zero storage space so you are constantly getting up to get things out of the storage bin above you or losing them under your seat. The BA lounge in LAX was ok nothing great (although the food was decent) and their South Lounge in LHR Terminal 5 was just ok - very busy and crammed with people. Nowhere to relax and enjoy some downtime. The food was the worst we've ever experienced in a lounge (only things available were horrible little sandwiches a few cookies and drinks. Since LHR is the hub for BA we expected way more. However our biggest issue was with the staff on board the flights. They were highly erratic in quality. Some were very friendly and helpful others were beyond rude. I had read that British Air now has a new system where the same staff does not do the same routes on a consistent basis. There are apparently a lot of ""floaters"" who come and go and work different flights by choice. To me this seems like a big mistake and most likely causes the huge discrepancy in service. Our flight home was an hour late (BA seems to be late a lot based on the many reviews). They also managed to lose all of our luggage. We travel a lot and will no longer choose British Airways as it's too much of a ""Russian Roulette"" as to whether your service will be good or not.";Business Class;5.0;3.0;1.0;3.0;5.0;3.0;0
british-airways;S Lewis;United Kingdom;2014-06-09;"We travelled Club Europe from Gatwick to Paphos as we were going out to get married. The extra luggage was handy due to the dress and all the extras that we needed to take but we could have paid for the extra space at much less a cost. As it was our wedding we decided to treat ourselves and go the full hog so spent nearly £1000 extra on Club Europe seats expecting to get a really good experience. Check in was quick and easy but there was no queue at the normal check in either so we didn't really benefit from that. The lounge was nothing particularly impressive although we didn't get there with much time to spare so that was more our fault. We were let on the plane first through the front of the plane the problem was that the rest of the passengers also came through the same door and through the Club Europe section so to be able to put our bags up into the compartment I had to stand by my seat until the entire plane had boarded. The seating then was just a row of 3 seats with the middle seat blocked off so although there was ""extra room"" it wasn't what I'd have expected. Our bags were marked as priority with the tags but came out with the rest of the luggage. I don't know if we went in expecting more than we should have but for the extra money we paid I think we were entitled to have higher expectations. Not an ideal way to start our wedding experience. We'd never travel Club Europe again it was a complete waste of money so hopefully others will read this and save the money to spend on the rest of the holiday!";Business Class;6.0;5.0;5.0;4.0;1.0;2.0;0

Held in boarding queue for about 20 minutes with no explanation. Then got onto flight to find no crew to help passengers in economy with on-boarding stowing luggage etc. I was sat in very last row and became apparent that the crew were sat at the back having a laugh. A large number of the passengers on this flight were elderly requiring help putting their hand baggage in the overhead lockers. Did the crew bother to look or help? No. They were sat up the back in the galley having a right old laugh. Only when we started taxi-ing could they be bothered to finish their chat and do a lacklustre safety demonstration. Which I couldn't see as the crew member demonstrating was right at the front of the plane. I couldn't hear the pilot announcement as the audio was faulty. No idea what he said or what flight conditions were. For a nervous passenger this is not great. Took off and then the crew started for service. The food I couldn't eat as allergic to one of the ingredients and told there was no other option. Fair enough. Was offered a drink about 20 mins before landing. Just as well I had my own water I guess. Finally crew member opened locker above my head on approach and her shoe fell out on my head. Wasn't painful per say but didn't get apology from crew member at all. She looked at me like it was my fault! I fly BA quite a bit and usually never much of an issue. I found the service on this flight incredible really. I'm still pinching myself to think it was actually BA. I left the flight feeling angry and slightly depressed if this is now the standard product from BA. The plane was old no map torn seats broken arm rests and rubbish in- flight service.

Heathrow T5 a complete overcrowded mess. Flight delayed by 90 minutes as they couldn't get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took far too long than it should've to resolve. And to make it all worse BA had a global baggage IT systems failure which resulted in my bag not making it to Singapore (despite checking in several hours before the flight). The flight itself was average at best. Upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired IFE limited food appalling. The only positive thing I can say was the crew smiled a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested they were trying. Can't imagine how BA can compete with SQ on this route given the absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline than it is today. They have no idea where my bag is or when I will get it and you can't contact BA in Singapore on the weekend as they are closed. One just gets the impression they couldn't care less.

Highlights of my journey include: Severe overheating on flight complaints ignored until someone fainted. Delayed on runway for 90 minutes for what was described as catering reasons. Running out of food and beverage 1 hr into a 11 hour flight. (No beer 1 hr in to flight - after the 90 minute delay). Uninterested and incompetent staff. Lost luggage. (1 case has so far turned up). Space reduced to less than a foot (Head to back of seat) once person in front inevitably reclines. I could honestly go on and on about how bad an experience this flight was and am being completely honest when I say that I am an easy customer to please.

The two upper deck cabins feel congested with more seats than the upper deck of a 747 yet noticeably fewer staff per passenger and too few toilets. The dinner service on the LHR-JNB flight was chronically slow (about three hours from beginning to end). The staff have been instructed to deliver drinks by hand from the galleys (rather than from a trolley) and to plate all the meals. All this takes too long with this level of staffing and the passenger experience suffers. The cabin crew were also curiously bad tempered perhaps due to the frustration of trying to deliver an over complicated meal service to increasingly disgruntled passengers.

british-airways;Shiva Raman;Australia;2014-06-01;Dublin to Sydney (via Heathrow and Singapore). Club Europe from Dublin to London and club world to Sydney. Flight to Heathrow delayed 40 mins due to weather which was fine. Upon arrival in Heathrow waited for an hour for the bus transfer leaving us 30 mins to make the next flight. Upon boarding the connection bus another 30 mins delayed. By this time it was about 10pm. Obviously missed the connecting flight to Sydney so tried to find a BA contact in terminal 4. Was then advised to go to terminal 1. No BA reps around and no 24 hr phone number. Then transferred to terminal 5. By this time it was midnight and still no BA contacts. Finally went to baggage services and saw a BA rep that had no idea what was going on and sent us to the first class lounge which was closed. Finally someone appeared at 1am who sorted out our hotel room and as the delay was caused by BA they provided us with the option of flying back to Sydney on BA or could see if they could get us on a China Southern flight (we had originally booked China Southern). We took the BA option as it was easiest and needed to come home. Next day arrived at airport and boarded through Gate C in terminal 5 (hate Heathrow airport). Lounge in Heathrow was fine over crowded but fine. Upon boarding the BA business class product we were very disappointed to say the least. Seats old aircraft old and the seating configuration was awful. We had the two middle seats E and F which were facing backwards however the seats on opposite sides are very close facing towards you. Flight left on time and arrived in Singapore on time. There was a delay of an hour in Singapore but again that couldn't be helped. They were also out of the express passes which was annoying and also lost our baggage - luckily it arrived two days later. Good luck if you're expecting to sleep on the flight. Seats were small and very uncomfortable. The amenity kits were ok however they ran out of eye masks. The hit towels were anything but hot. Food was below average. Overall I wouldn't recommend British Airways Club Europe/world. The best I've experienced so far from Sydney to Europe would have to be on China Southern.

It took me 3 hours to get a drink - the staff were cheerful they simply didn't do anything. A full flight and at least one washroom out of action was an additional pain. Transit through LHR is always an unalloyed joy and this time I had to go through immigration which added to the fun but despite this I still had time for a very quick shower between flights - hooray and full marks for the lounge staff.

Although it was not classed as an upgrade to First because it was business class service it should still have been a lovely experience. Yes the seat and all the space was great but the first words I heard as being offered a drink was - ""Can't wait for this flight to be over"". This was from one of the stewards to another steward but that attitude was the same amongst all the crew serving the cabin. I hope BA read this forum as the service really was appalling.

Dinner was produced a short time into the flight and a snack provided before landing. The journey from JFK was worse. Same problem with rude and disdainful stewardess. We paid extra for extra legroom at the front of the cabin and found more seats had been installed in front which resulted in such short room that my knees were touching the seat in front for the whole trip back. when the seat in front was reclined it was impossible to view the monitor in front of me.

british-airways;S Arangelov;Bulgaria;2014-05-27;"Heathrow - Johannesburg A380. My first flight on A380. After half an hour delay because of planes late arrival boarding started. First thing I noticed was how tiny the seats were. Second thing to notice is that the plane was not properly cleaned. There were grease stains and empty cans left behind. At this point I noticed some toilet paper between the panels above my head. When asked the cabin crew explained this is how they fixed condensation problem from the air conditioning. Anyhow time for lift off. I turned on the inflight entertainment system to watch it from the camera at the tail of the plane. After looking for 5 minutes I couldn't find it anywhere. (Later I found out there is no such option on BA A380s). So no tail cam fine let's listen to some music. Wrong the headphones are not working. Cabin crew assures me they will ""bring me some more"". One hour later suffice it to say cabin crew did not bring anything. I've managed to grab a pair of unused headphones from one empty seat just to find out they were not working either. Probably it was some problem with the jack in the seat rendering the whole inflight entertainment system pointless. And if that was not enough it was time for dinner. By the time it was my turn BA had run out of ""chicken"" so my dinner was asparagus with rice or something like that. You don't even have to look at it to understand why everyone else was choosing the ""chicken"". So no edible dinner and soundless entertainment system. Pretty much spent the rest of the journey counting the minutes until I could get off this plane.

Had the 5-course taster menu but different wines than those which were suggested. Was very good indeed did not have the dessert but the better half pronounced it outstanding.

There is little point in fast tracking us at other stages of the journey to ignore us at this point. Good flight excellent cabin crew - why can't BA have a consistency of cabin crew quality? Today's crew were excellent - attentive engaged appropriately friendly and amusing and consistent with their service throughput the flight. Food was fine champagne improved from previous flights. Quality of cabin still modest - upgrade of the cabins really should be a priority but I fear that BA's focus is on the long haul not those of us who travel within Europe.

british-airways;G Sims;United Kingdom;2014-05-20;Recently returned from Mauritius to Gatwick in Club World and have to say that the service was woefully lacking. Left on time. The cabin crew were obviously tired and the welcome glass of Champagne was served without smiles or a welcome. Throughout the whole flight the crew did the absolute minimum and there was very little interaction with the passengers. Breakfast was disgusting and served soon after take-off. A little round casserole dish of British Breakfast ingredients all piled together and searingly hot and overcooked and tasteless. Awful insipid coffee. After that some of the crew disappeared for a sleep and we were left to ourselves. Nobody asked if we wanted anything nobody chatted I rang for a drink and nobody came. The galley 'kitchen/snack bar' was almost bare and had two manky stale smoked-salmon sandwiches and a few bottles of water. On asking for a glass (there were none) for wine I was told to sit down and one would be brought as indeed it was ten minutes later with no smiles or nibbles. Throughout the flight I felt guilty asking for a G&T or wine because of the negative attitude of certain cabin crew. Lunch was just about OK and very good wine. After that for the next five hours nothing was served to refresh us before landing - no tea no cakes no nothing. The seating configuration was 2-4-2 (Boeing 777) and packed in like sardines - claustrophobic for some. To access the aisle from the window you have to climb over the legs of the person behind and the food is served across the lap of the aisle seat over the partition. We were a couple but if you are travelling alone it could make for some very strange eye-to-eye contact with a stranger. The IFE was dated and a very limited choice with poor quality fuzzy screens. The whole package was so minimal soulless and lacking. Not once were you made to feel special or 'pampered' in any way. If there is an alternative in future to BA I'll take it and compared with some Middle-East airlines the Club World product is embarrassingly mediocre. BA needs to refresh review and up-date quickly.

british-airways;Connie Green;United Kingdom;2014-05-19;Recently for our honeymoon we took advantage of a BA promo to fly in to Singapore and then to Hong Kong via Cathay Pacific and back to UK. Our flight out to Singapore was easy and relaxed because I think it was not a busy flight. We did ask to have a wedding photo canvas to be checked in to save us the hassle of lugging it around but was flatly refused. The canvas was less than 1kg properly packed for delivery but just slightly awkward to be carried around. We understand BA has a one bag check in policy and no flexibility but we were not too bothered anyway although a little kind gesture would have been appreciated. Our flight on Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong was great! We were allowed to check in 3 pieces of luggage between 2 of us that weighed less than 40kg food was fantastic and the service was immaculate. On our way back to London we were excited as we knew we were flying the A380. SQ and Emirates have A380 we have flown. This turned out to be a mistake from the start. When we were checking in we were not allowed to check in extra hand luggage despite the combined weight of less than 40kg for all 3 items. When we got on the plane we were shocked to see how tiny the seats on the BA A380 were in comparison to SQ or even Emirates. Next we struggled to find an overhead cabin compartment for our hand luggage. The staff instead of helping us find a space for the bag stood on her spot pointing at cabins that looked empty but were 10 over rows away from our seats. The ultimate bad experience came when breakfast was served. By the time the trolley came to us there were no more options for our breakfast and the food was just plonked on our trays. No apologies no explanations as to what was under the foil no smiles! I was quite upset by now as I had to ask the stewardess what was being served. I have never felt more humiliated. With BA it was just silence. Miserable unhappy lifeless crews at work who can't seem to care less with their customers. No smiles no interactions no explanations no communication. Needless to say the highly unpopular dim sum with noodles for breakfast was left untouched! Our overall flying experience with BA has been anything but pleasant friendly generous comfortable with delicious meals. It had just served as a reminder why I have not chosen BA the last 10 years and perhaps the next 10 to come.;Economy;2.0;1.0;1.0;2.0;3.0;5.0;0
british-airways;R Richards;United Kingdom;2014-05-18;LGW-Antigua on 29 April and Antigua-LGW on 13 May Boeing 777. It started off badly when I went to pay the final payment on line on evening of 16 February. The system rejected both my credit and debit cards. On checking the state of my account with BA online I found that the final payment had been credited to my account and I now owed the initial deposit. I sent an email to get it sorted only to receive a reply that it could only be sorted out by a telephone call. First call was useless with a person who had poor grasp of English. Another call to a premium number required a 20 minute wait to get someone to sort out the problem having been passed round twice. I was told it had been sorted out and received E ticket email with my state of account showing I owed nothing. Two weeks later I received another E ticket the only difference now was that it showed the last four digits of my credit card. Next credit card statement did not show money taken out. Not unusual for some companies but made me nervous that all was not well. Two weeks before flight I got a phone call from BA stating that there had been a computer glitch and could they have my credit card details. I then received an email apology and confirmation all had been paid. About 22 hours before flight I went online to check in and changed my seats and entered passport details etc and printed boarding pass. Arrived at LGW to just print baggage labels and drop off baggage. Met by man at terminal who tore up my boarding pass and printed off a new one saying ‘bring back the old system. We then had to queue to drop off baggage. Other than choosing seat it was a complete waste of time to check in online. Flight left and arrived on time. However the inflight main meal was the worst I have ever experienced on an aircraft. There was no choice and the red wine was undrinkable. The inflight food on my first flight a forces trooping flight to Singapore in 1962 was better. On return flight you could only check in online and alter seat position. Check in at Antigua was one of the quickest check ins I have ever done. Left Antigua on time and arrived LGW on time. Food was worse than going out. No choice. Starter was small chopped up lettuce leaf with small tomato wedge with a rotten end to it. Main was very dry pasta with a tomato sauce on it. White wine was just about drinkable. Coffee served as we started main course. Asked if we could have it later and told no as turbulence was expected. No turbulence but cabin crew quick to clear up and disappear for a bit of shut eye leaving minimum staff on duty.

The return started off poorly with substandard facilities at Santorini airport including no online check-in no business class lounge and no priority boarding.

Staff friendly and a good snack and beverage included. Good updates from cabin and we left and arrived on time. Trip back felt like it had been crewed by brand new staff in the cabin. Food handed out 20 mins after take-off but drinks took another 30 mins to be offered around cabin. Half the cabin crew seemed too pre-occupied with passengers not sitting in correct seat even though flight not full. Think a smile and re-assurance to move back after take-off would have sorted the issue however one female crew member in particular had forgotten to bring her 'happy face' to work that day! Flight OK but not up to standard you expect. I fly BA quite regularly and choose over EasyJet as fares and flight times often similar but service superior.

british-airways;C Tyler;United Kingdom;2014-05-18;When we booked our holiday to Barbados I was really pleased to see we were flying with British Airways as they have a good reputation. Sadly our experiences put a lie to this. As part of the service they offer BA allow you to either pay an expensive premium to choose your seats in advance or you can log onto their website for free 24 hours in advance. I tried to do this several times without success and finally rang the helpline number suggested. After a 14 minute call at premium rate the call operator (whose grasp of English wasn't great) was unable to advise about the problem nor manually book our seats and could offer nothing more constructive than “keep trying”. I rang the complaints line (still premium rate) and other than a better grasp of English was still unable to assist in any way. Both operators assured me that they would sort it all at the Airport. So in view of this we arranged to arrive at the airport early. We entered our details online to find that even though there were only 2 of us we weren't sat together or even on the same row. By now my wife – who is a nervous flyer – was in tears! We then sought assistance and had to queue but eventually we're allocated 2 seats together. As they were free I don't know why these weren't given originally – however given our further experiences – maybe they don't like using them? I have flown long haul before and found that you always get a more generous allocation of space particularly shoulder and legroom. Sadly British Airways don't appear to follow this doctrine. The legroom was adequate however as soon as the woman in front reclined her seat I had about 4 inches between the front of my nose and the back of her seat. As my TV screen is in the back of this seat it made trying to watch the screen extremely difficult. I managed to watch 1 film however this brought on a headache so I was forced to stop. I would love to see what regulations BA have to follow regarding VDU viewing however in a work environment this would be banned without question. The final disappointment came when the food was distributed. I had the Thai Chicken which was over-cooked so that the rice was cremated to the top and bottom of the container whilst my wife had the cottage pie which tasted of plastic. She didn't eat hers. I ate mine but had a stomach upset for the following 48 hours. All in all this was an experience I do not want to repeat and I shall certainly not fly British Airways by choice in the future!

british-airways;Steve Adolfo;United Kingdom;2014-05-17;Travelling as a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 young children) from London to Boston I hoped there wouldn't be a problem sitting together in the 4 middle seats. I had not paid to reserve my seat as I had never had to pay extra before while flying with Emirates Singapore or Cathay Pacific. The seats allocated at check in were 3 on the left (A/B/C). My wife sat with the kids while I had to sit in the row behind. The seats could not be changed at check in or on the plane. It seemed ridiculous that we were not allocated the logical place for a family of 4 in the middle of the plane even though my flight had been booked 5 months in advance. I warned the stewardess that the situation would be difficult for my family for the staff and the passengers around as this proved when my 3 year old cried as he wanted to sit next to me. I had to swap seats with my wife a couple of times during the flight it was a stressful flight. On the return flight I reluctantly paid extra (£23 x 4) to make sure we got the 4 middle seats. The journey was less stressful but my wife had her own issues as she couldn't recline as the passenger behind was too tall and refused to move his legs (he should have paid and extra £23 and reserved a seat with more leg room). My wife complained to the steward as the passenger refused to let my wife recline he was made to move to a different seat. In conclusion I found staff were generally friendly but didn't exert themselves on service the food was okay but the entertainment system was dated it didn't have any games and the screen kept freezing. It seems the flight services to USA are not up to the same standard as flying to the Middle East or the Far East as British Airways had failed in comparison at all levels when compared with the other airlines mentioned earlier - my last experience to the USA was with American Airlines and that was worse than BA. The main disappointing issue with BA is definitely having to pay extra for choosing your seat. If you are travelling with a family of 4 and you want to guarantee you sit together you have to pay an extra £200 on top of the original cost of the return ticket this felt more like the additional charges of Ryanair!;Economy;3.0;2.0;3.0;3.0;2.0;1.0;0

Our flight was delayed by an hour which did effect our layover and did rush us to our next flight but we had a cushion of 2 hours layover so we were ok. On the flight the seats were more comfortable more leg room less noisy better entertainment due to screens on seats in front of you and the access to the bathroom was much easier to navigate. We also had seats relatively together which the other airline refused to offer us even though we had made the reservation months in advance. Their screen was so far ahead I couldn't see it and it offered only one choice. The staff was very kind to hydrate us frequently and gave us plenty to eat and it was all very palatable.

Return navigating Barajas is not easy and the T4S Iberia lounge was crowded and difficult to find a seat. 767 aircraft now fitted with bigger screens. Service was lunch pasta and chicken or prawn Caesar salad and a creamy dessert. Both enjoyable. Service was even better than on outbound the CSD was personable and very interactive with all pax as were all the crew. She took time out to explain and show the meal options and chat with the pax.

Flight from LHR to JFK started in perfect conditions: First lounge in Terminal 5 (as a gold member) with excellent champagne and food and place. Boarding was smooth with helpful crew a nice drink to welcome us on board and to relax and a nice smile. In one word the start of a perfect flight in a full cabin landing on time in New York.

I was traveling BLR-LHR-SFO route on 9th of May 2014. The first flight from BLR-LHR was chaotic and as mentioned by others on this site most food options were exhausted by the end of the flight. I don't complain because I got my food choice. The flight staff had some really courteous people while some were pretty snobbish. The second flight is really what's worth mentioning - it was the most cheerful flight I have been on! The flight attendants were entertaining the pains of being on a second leg of a 24 hr journey was not felt. BA 287 flying on 9th May 2014 - fantastic flight. Food was okay - I loved the Lily O Brien chocolate mousse! Entertainment - its high time BA upgrades its entertainment systems.

If you want to take the risk I travel BA to Tampa premium economy three times a year the food is disgusting and I always sit in aisle 14 now if anyone has booked there seat in this aisle be warned they run out of choices on the menu when they get to you and they offer you an economy meal and quite frankly they do not care if you complain well I complained! Myself and the man seated next to me kept up the complaining and 15 mins later the steward comes up with two beef dishes. The crew had kept these meals for themselves.

At the boarding gate the staff were just so disorganised in getting the passengers on board that we had to wait for almost an hour before we got on. The plane was an old and tired 747-400 which had the dirtiest cabin I have seen. There was a stale smell lingering in the premium economy cabin. The seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium economy. The inflight entertainment was a joke. The video quality was mediocre and the noise cancelling headphones were not working for most of the flight. The food was some strange fried rice which was bland. The crew were unfriendly they didn't serve drinks once throughout the flight. The worst part were the toilets smelly with a toilet bowl and sink choked with toilet paper.

Nice breakfast with individual bottles of Heidseck Monopole champagne. No aerobridges at Verona so had to walk to a bus in the rain. Bags delivered quickly. Return flight was delayed by an hour as the incoming flight was late. BA use the Catullo lounge which is very poor with an abysmal selection of food-nothing hot not even a sandwich just biscuits and pastries at 9pm!

Try to get a window/aisle seat if you are travelling as a couple but you will be lucky unless you are prepared to pay £60 to choose your seat. Otherwise you will be allocated a seat 24 hours before the flight and there are limited choices to change your seat allocation on a busy flight. In the middle 4 seats you will be either facing someone during service take off and landing or sat next to someone with a small partition between you. In all seats the foot rest is part of the bed and blocks access so you will either have to step over or be stepped over to leave your seat. The seats were comfortable in all positions. Dinner was average but less elegant than meals on other leading airlines. Breakfast was a disaster; hardly any of the choices on the menu were available but no explanation or apology were offered which was typical of the functional unsmiling flight attendants.

We boarded the aircraft and sat in our seats realising we had a long haul flight in short haul seat pitch with a very small seat width designed for a below averaged size person. This wasn't at all helped by the passenger in front reclining their seat immediately after the seatbelt sign went off. Food was basic small meal return flight included a breakfast consisting of a small bread roll with a bitesize cereal bar. Both legs went at least 4hrs without any food/drink service. IFE was quite good have to watch 5 minutes of adverts before the programme starts. Family near us had a child with no working IFE for return flight. What annoyed us most was on the return leg we were told by the flight attendant ""Do you mind moving forward so the couple behind you can eat?"". We did presuming it was policy whilst finding it strange it never happened on the outbound flight. No one else was asked to move the seat forward so we felt angered that we were the only ones asked.

First time in a premium cabin. The seats are comfortable if a little narrow but they easily move to the lie flat position meaning I was able to get 6 hours sleep. Plenty of good quality champagne and wines offered before and during dinner. 3 course dinner sounded a lot better than it actually tasted. BA should think more about ease of food preparation on board rather than trying to do lavish dishes that don't quite come off. Breakfast was better than expected - plenty of choice and a good selection of fresh rolls and croissants. AVOD worked well. My only complaint was that the cabin crew found it very difficult to be friendly. Every request appeared to be an inconvenience to them - little things like milk and sugar for my coffee. Generally though I would have to give Club World the thumbs up if only because a lie flat bed is infinitely more appealing than cramped Economy on a 12 hour flight.

The Food is without doubt some of the worst I have had in Business anywhere poorly presented badly prepared and barely edible. The AVOD looks like it was installed 10 years ago and then wasn't the top of the range screen size is terrible viewing angles and resolution poor. The seats work well as a lie flat configuration.

The service started soon after takeoff since this was a very short flight this consisted of a trolley with drinks and snacks - as is usual on BA Domestic services. There were 5 men in front of me returning from a weekend break who were given 2 gin and tonics each and the cabin steward was very friendly with them. He got to me and stared I stared back I took it he had forgotten to say ""may I offer you something from the bar"" or something similar.

That in itself would have been ok - it was perfectly acceptable pasta but the starter was a pasta salad. Not very sensible offering 2 dishes almost the same. The crew did what was required of them - serve drinks and food but then we didn't see them again for 9 hours until breakfast was served.

As this was with BA I tried for an hour to choose a seat to no avail. My itinerary came up but told me I was being redirected to American. So I called BA they told me I was to check in at Kansas City before I could have a seat assigned. So I called American a very unhelpful person told me that I had to go to back to BA. I called BA again after explaining I had seat booked with American from Kansas but could not get one with BA she put me on hold for 15 minutes and told me I had a seat - trouble was it was the one from Kansas to Chicago.
