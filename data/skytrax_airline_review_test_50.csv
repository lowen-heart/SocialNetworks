british-airways;Donna Miller;United States;2015-08-01;Considering BA's fares were high to begin with and you had to purchase your seats to secure in advance we still booked on the advice of our British son in law. Plane is so large takes a long time to board and disembark. We flew Premium Economy, seats are bigger and have leg room but they're not comfortable for some reason. Flight crew was fine and professional. Inflight entertainment was fine but new movie selection was small. Cabin and seats were clean and neat. Inflight kit consisted of socks, ear plugs, mask, pen and tiny toothpaste and brush.  They offer pillows and blankets. But although the seats are wider, they weren't easy to get in and out of, and not just us a number of passengers contorted just to get out. The meals were fine, though served on a tiny tray loaded with food, the meal was pretty good. Not a lot of choices, to London, beef or pasta, from London back to LA, it was beef or fish. It was hot and there was a lot of food, a salad, small  cheese and  crackers. Roll butter and dessert but I'm not sure I'd say it was what BA's advertisement claims. It didn't feel it was a premium meal. They also served snacks but it was flashed on the overhead with no explanation of where to go to get the snacks. The entire plane was dark. The second meal was a breakfast, but not especially appealing. On the return to LA, it was a very odd casserole, rather dry and bland. The flight was smooth and arrived on time, coming back we were an hour late waiting as the pilot informed us of sixty passengers arriving late from Germany. They lost one of our suitcases enroute, we arrived on Thursday afternoon, the bag was delivered late Friday night to our hotel, no offer to help with expense of having to buy what was needed until bag was found. Not even an email or text, we finally asked the hotel who said it arrived midnight Friday, we weren't notified by BA until Saturday afternoon. We ended up spending quite a lot buying shirts, underwear and shorts to get by. If we'd known they had found the bag we wouldn't have spent the money. Poor communication on their part. Not an apology or sorry for the inconvenience. I guess they figured we should be grateful we got the bag at all. I doubt we'd fly BA again sadly I'd hoped for something special.;Premium Economy;7.0;2.0;5.0;4.0;4.0;3.0;0
british-airways;C Lindsay;United Kingdom;2015-08-01;We flew Business Class to Vienna on the 28/7/15, Terminal 3 is a dismal place and the lounge reflected this. There was very poor food choices and everything was tired including the staff. The outward journey was okay, flight attendant was pleasant. I think the meal choices could be improved - these tickets are not cheap. However the return flight (31/7/15) which was in economy - also not cheap, was not good at all. The attitude of the staff was really below par. The food choice was an iced bun and a chicken/bacon bun. Seeing the choice I asked for the vegetarian option-Couscous with a few slices of pepper - all of which were tasteless.  When asked would I like a drink I replied - Bloody Mary. I should have known better, as this was the attendant who having to do a live safety demo chewed and smirked the whole way through, produced the drink without any WS. I asked if I could have some and then watched him add a good 1cm to the drink - turning the tomato juice a dark brown. BA need to remember we as the customers pay their wages.;Economy;3.0;3.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;2.0;0
british-airways;John Durkin;Australia;2015-08-01;The staff were great, food was pretty good, their seating policy is a sham. For that reason I'd never fly with BA again. I have issues with arthritis and they changed my Aisle seat to a window seat at the last moment and I had to endure no room to move for most of our flight from London to Sydney.;Economy;3.0;1.0;4.0;4.0;3.0;1.0;0
british-airways;John Bradley;United Kingdom;2015-07-31;Short trip to Vienna in BA Economy Class from Terminal 3. New A320 cabin on the flight out - looks nice and fairly comfortable for a couple of hours. Other than the cheap, highly processed cheese and ham croissant and a coffee you are given it is no different to a low cost airline. Staff service minimal - they served breakfast and collected the leftovers, basically in the cabin twice during the entire 2 hour and 10 minute flight - not even an additional beverage service. I'm sure if they were flogging the drinks it would be different. Return a couple of days later, older aircraft but clean. Same indifferent service, similar processed carbs handed out in silence and 1 drink. This wasn't a cheap ticket (over 200GBP) - I know BA are competing with low cost airlines in Europe but when are they going to realise they aren't a low cost airline? A bit of chat from the staff and a couple of extra coffees would have made all difference to how I felt leaving those flights. BA sadly seem to be falling behind the crowd.;Economy;4.0;4.0;2.0;2.0;0.0;2.0;0
british-airways;B Stauffer;South Africa;2015-07-31;British Airways Business Class product has not really changed over the last 15 years, and they are now far behind competition in seat comfort (half of the passengers must still fly facing backwards) and entertainment. What once made BA a great airline was the cabin crew who treated their passengers like guests. Unfortunately, they are slowly retiring and replaced by younger employees who could care or less about high revenue passengers. On this particular flight, the cabin was half full, but the crew rushed the service to an extent I have never seen before: the pre-dinner drinks were served, and less than 5 minutes later, I was served the first course. I did not even start the salad when the plate was taken away and I was presented with a beef fillet that was totally overcooked. Ten minutes later, the trays were taken away, and the lights dimmed. We did not see the crew again for the next 9 hours, and no water or juice were ever served. Unfortunately BA has the only non-stop flight between Cape Town and London, but next time I will fly Emirates via Dubai even if that means adding 4 hours to the trip.;Business Class;2.0;2.0;1.0;2.0;2.0;1.0;0
british-airways;Yang Zhou;South Korea;2015-07-29;Had a very unpleasant experience with BA this time. They changed our family seats without warning. First time flying with two babies, booked the ticket and reserved two seats together sitting together with husband. Both babies are lap seat. Two days before the flight I called the BA service to make sure our seats and ticket are all fine and got a positive answer. On the day of boarding found out out seats are moved apart. For 12 hours flight, our family seats are arranged far apart. After more than 40 minutes standing at the counter waiting for the coordination, we could sit across the aisle when we get on the plane. No food for my 2 year old. If we are not allowed to bring food onto the plane, what do BA expect baby can eat? No help from staff with any service. When babies are crying and very restless  we didn't get any help from BA staff. When I flew with other airlines, flight attendant brought small toys to help distract and entertain baby. BA forgot to unload out stroller when we landed.;Premium Economy;4.0;2.0;1.0;2.0;0.0;3.0;0
british-airways;MichaÃ«l Steiner;Switzerland;2015-07-29;This was my return flight of my trip in the USA. From Europe to the USA we had an Airbus A380 which was modern and quite enjoyable to fly. My return flight was on a Boeing 747. The aircraft was quite old with seats which weren't so comfortable but at least fully OK. The flight was good, cabin crew were friendly, sometimes  absent in the cabin and not very happy when you asked them something.  The food was OK, not gastronomic but acceptable in an economy class. We had delays of 35 minutes by landing, so the flight were quite on time, though that the longest delay was due of an engine problem. I recommend British Airways even for short flights (if you book early and fares not too high) than for longer ones. One reason more is that connections in Heathrow are easy when you have two BA flights, transfer done in 35mins.;Economy;7.0;4.0;3.0;3.0;4.0;4.0;1
british-airways;Eamon Callan;United Kingdom;2015-07-28;I have flown in business class with BA on many occasions and found the service to be hit and miss. If you get an indifferent crew - which, in my experience, is not far off half the time - they want you to eat your dinner as fast as possible, go to sleep and not bother them any more. Once such a crew spot the blankets coming out they cease interest in you, never check on you, and leave you to ask for everything. I have never had that experience in business class with other airlines, for example Emirates, EVA or Lan Chile, quite the opposite. Anyway, BA were offering a special price to upgrade (cash only) to first on my Vancouver-Heathrow flight. I thought I'd try it. It was a waste of money. The first sign of trouble was the fact that I was not welcomed or addressed by name - an absolute must I think. Then the (male, and they tend to be the worst on BA, I am sorry to say) flight attendant came round handing out menus as though we were in economy - he just doled them out rather than hand them to, and speak to, each passenger in a personal manner. The wine selection didn't seem so very much better than business class and when I asked a specific question (flavour of champagne) the flight attendant didn't know the answer. I eat slowly and was still on my main course (lamb, and rather dry) when the dreaded time arrived for the blankets to make their appearance. I thought 'Oh no, surely not in first'. Well, I was wrong. I was left staring at my dirty plate and eventually had to summon the flight attendant and ask to see the menu for dessert. After that, unbelievably, I was abandoned again and, in protest, got up from my seat and went off in search of a crew member. I asked to speak to the cabin services director (female, delighful manner) who was full of apologies, of course, and off I went back to my seat. When I was finally given coffee, the flight attendant who brought it (another female) confided that BA don't have the staff numbers to pay the same attention to first or business passengers that some other airlines do, I couldn't believe my ears. As for the cabin, being in the nose of the 747,I felt cramped. The mood-changing lighting doesn't compensate for the dark, monotone blue of the seats and carpet. The in-light entertainment was to my surprise just the same as on the rest of the plane. I know this reads like a demolition job on BA but I have made no exaggerations. I really think Willie Walsh should don a false beard and shades and take a decent number of flights in business and first on his own planes. He'd find out for himself. I want BA to be the best and it simply isn't. Lastly, my experience of the hit and miss service of BA business class is shared by every other person I have ever mentioned it to. If you're flying BA stay in business class, you're not missing anything.;First Class;2.0;4.0;1.0;3.0;1.0;1.0;0
british-airways;Dave Houlihan;United Arab Emirates;2015-07-27;This review is written due to what I feel is true reflection of the decline of a once great airline. Check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. The first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff I have ever come across. The lounge was fine, but it is looking tired. Service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. No priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). Opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. Staff very pleasant, professional, and very helpful. Food ok not First class, wines good. The entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. The seat would not lie flat and hard to move. Bought on board duty free and asked would I need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. Deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to, given wrong directions to the lounge. Had to clear immigration although not entering the UK, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free I bought on board could not go through I would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. This was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. Connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited at the gate. Flight to Dublin short, salad served and tea. Priority bags were the last bags on the belt. Overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. I fly 12-14 times a year and gold level. BA you have lost your edge, I will stay loyal to Qatar, Emirates and Cathay Pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business. My advice do not waste your money with BA, it's service cutting to the point of insult.;First Class;1.0;2.0;3.0;2.0;1.0;1.0;0
british-airways;A Gibson;United Kingdom;2015-07-27;"Quick online check-in and boarding passes with the BA mobile APP. It is so easy to use and definitely helps you to get rid of those annoying loose bits of paper from your cabin bags. Manchester Airport Terminal 3 is bursting at the seams during the summer holiday mornings. There's a severe lack of seats in this terminal but despite this, the security check didn't take too long at all. The BA ground staff at Manchester seemed friendly enough and boarded strictly in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front. This helps stop the queuing in the aisles onboard to get to your seat. We were greeted at the aircraft door by a couple of cheerful and friendly crew. The refreshed cabin now looks very modern, welcoming and clean. The comfort of the new seats and the space on this aircraft (A321) I feel would be more than sufficient for a flight of 2-3 hours or so (I'm 5ft 11""). With a fully loaded cabin and a flight time to Heathrow of just over 30 minutes the crew were quick into action. We were offered a hot breakfast bacon wrap, orange juice and tea or coffee, perfect for such a short flight and definitely helps set BA apart from the competition. The flight arrived into Terminal 5 a few minutes ahead of schedule and outside the UK Arrivals area less than ten minutes later.";Economy;10.0;4.0;5.0;5.0;0.0;5.0;1
british-airways;Linda Wilson;United Kingdom;2015-07-27;I am a very frequent long haul traveller and although I will often choose the Asian carriers (e.g. Singapore Airlines, JAL, Cathay) over British Airways, being based in London means that I do often fly with BA. I find BA's long haul business class offering though innovative when it was launched in the 90s has now been way outclassed by many of its competitors. The seats don't quite lie flat (and it's not unusual to get a broken seat) and half the passengers have to go backwards and climb over other passengers to get out - I can't think of any other major airline that has this any more in business class. I am told by a BA contact that they considered changing the configuration for the A380s, but didn't in the end. Worst of all, I find the onboard service incredibly inconsistent - most often it's a little begrudging, occasionally it is excellent and sometimes it is downright awful. I was particularly annoyed at my customer service experience on a flight from LHR to Tokyo Haneda, when settling down in my seat, I looked down to find a dirty napkin, used earplugs and toothpick and significant quantities of broken glass around my feet (good job I hadn't taken my shoes off at this stage). My husband flagged down a member of cabin crew, who said she would come and clear it, but didn't. I flagged down the Cabin Services Director who did bring a dustpan and brush and said he would report it. Upon my return, I complained to BA. After three weeks, they deigned to reply, but it was on the lines of 'our cabins are always cleaned to the highest standards, we are sorry you didn't find this to your liking' - effectively implying that I was making a fuss over nothing.;Business Class;3.0;1.0;2.0;4.0;4.0;4.0;0
british-airways;K Weller;United Kingdom;2015-07-26;Booked for our trip to Uganda, in Feb 2015 we spent Â£1450 for 2 return tickets, had to pay an additional Â£100 to reserve seats on the flights. About 2 days ago I received a text message (not a call) saying that our flight had been cancelled - left us in the dark until I had to phone their 0844 number to get transferred to a Delhi call centre, when I was told I could get a full refund they tried to only refund me for the flights and not the seats on this now, non existant flight. I had to phone back a further 2 times to get through to someone that could understand that I did want my Â£100 as well.

british-airways;Bob Motto;United Kingdom;2015-07-25;Flew Club Europe to Istanul on 767, boarding was speedy and boarding completed quickly for an on time departure. The flight was excellent and the crew in Club Europe were as always providing excellent service and professional at all times. Although the 767 is showing its age, I still prefer this aircraft to the A320's which also are used on this route, on the 767 at least the Club Europe seats are comfortable and offer plenty of leg room unlike the new Club Europe which is used on the A320's which is in reality going back to the days of charter airlines! So come on British Airways lets go back to the old configurations where we have plenty of leg room in Club Europe and reduce the rows of seats, we do not want Low Cost Airline look alikes otherwise we would fly them, we choose BA because we are loyal to you so bring back your old standards once again.;Business Class;9.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;3.0;5.0;1
british-airways;Lawrence Hunt;United Kingdom;2015-07-25;"BA seems to be losing its ability to run an airline. I have had 4 flights canclled in the last 3 months, 3 of them while I was at the gate. Every flight which does operate is delayed. Staff attitude is appallimg, they just don't seem to care. I have no compensation. My step daughter was deinied boarding due to BA overbooking.

british-airways;Eric Rose;United Kingdom;2015-07-25;"Previously a loyal BA customer, I Usually travel economy on shorthaul but I am 6'4"" with long legs and am very uncomfortable unless I can get Exit row. So on this flight I took advantage of a what I thought was a reasonably priced Club World ticket expecting the past 34 inch seat pitch. Horrified to find on boarding that BA have reduced the seat pitch to 30 inch - exactly the same as in economy. The presence of an empty middle seat and pathetic little table for your tablet computer is no compensation. Fortunately this was a short flight but even so I was extremely uncomfortable. Cabin staff and other passengers said there had been loads of complaints but clearly BA don't care. I sometimes go to Cyprus and the thought of a 4 hr+ flight in these cramped seats puts me off totally. The meal was passable but as the flight took off a couple of minutes before midday it was classed as ""late breakfast"" and no wine was served. It is clear that BA are putting profit over customer service and I am amazed that anyone travels Club Europe. Later in the year I was due to travel to South America via Madrid in Business Class but have now cancelled and switched to another airline. In future I will avoid BA shorthaul wherever possible.";Business Class;1.0;1.0;4.0;2.0;0.0;1.0;0
british-airways;Alan Thompson;United Kingdom;2015-07-23;Booked a hand luggage only fare at short notice so it was pricey. Allocated a decent seat but amazed at charge of â¬26 to change it so didn't bother. Flight seemed to be full of families split up probably for the same reason. A ripoff. Flight was late, usual excuse of late arrival from a previous flight. Flight deck crew affable. Food and drink good and free, a bonus. Cabin attendants, an older purser up front a bit patronising. The two in economy were really going through the motions, no eye contact and perfunctory service. 1 drink served in a 2.5 hour flight. For the last hour the two at the back were eating Club Europe meals which I saw them bring from the front. This was BA2591 on 22 July. Not great.;Economy;7.0;4.0;1.0;4.0;0.0;3.0;1

I was allocated seat 11A which had the tightest leg-room I have experienced, luckily it was only a short 50 min flight.

Heathrow T3 departure experience is quite shoddy compared to T2 or main BA flights out of T5. Service onboard the flight was perfunctory at best, and staff seem to perform to a script - in some cases portray the feeling that because they wear a BA uniform they think they are so excellent - a sad fact is their standards are below several major European airlines. The Purser, CSD (or whichever grand title they give to cabin staff) on outbound flight spent a lot of time giggling in the galley like a 6 year old child, and then proceeded to make the PA announcements in the campest and most disrespectful tone of voice - again, this seemed to be done for the amusement of his fellow t-d's.

This being said, after my first flight with BA when my luggage stayed in Tampa and didn't make it to the UK until four days after I'd arrived, I stayed fairly calm. Mistakes are made. My flight had been canceled (which seems like commonplace at BA), and was re-booked after only three hours on the phone. When I ventured to take my trip home, I was notified via text message that my flight had been canceled yet again. After speaking to a calm man about my horrible experience thus far, he informed me of a customer care number that I could call and complain about my flight. Let's remember I'm a teacher, and I also payed $1,800 for this trip. That's an entire months pay just so we all know. I'm meant to leave tomorrow and still have not received confirmation via email.

british-airways;Aadheer Warriar;United Kingdom;2015-07-21;The baggage check in took forever, it was 45-50min of standing in the queue. The flight looked good and well maintained 777. Inflight entertainment was good and updated to latest movies, documentaries, talk shows 5* for that. The seating space was just about good enough. Be careful of the head set it can get in the way and snap. The air conditioner was not up to the mark so it was warm in the cabin. The inflight food was extremely hot, in short it was burnt. The answer from the flight crew when someone asked for a second helping of 150ml coke can is that they needed to keep stock for the return flight.

Inflight entertainment was alright, but do take note to always unplug the headset whenever you get out of your seat. It damages easily if it gets caught on something. I had to change 2 headsets because of that, because being in a aisle seat, you have to get off when someone wants to use the lavatory, thus remember to unplug it if you intend to get up from your seat. Service was alright. I requested for eye shades, and it came about 1hr later, crew must have forgotten about my request. I didn't pursue it as I thought I could just head to the back galley and request for them after my movie. In terms of food, it was appalling and greasy. Overall, I will not say never again, but given a choice, I'd look out for Singapore Airlines first, then the big 3 Gulf carriers.

I suspect the plane might have seen better days given that the entertainment system was ancient - no games, small screen compared with the likes of Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. Some cost cutting evident - no menus, hot towels, metal cutlery - which is fine by me.

BA should be commended for retaining 9-abreat seating in the 777, legroom is adequate and adjustable headrest is a nice touch. AVOD was decent, with clear screen, though movie selection was not extensive. Catering was marginal on the outbound flight from Atlanta, with breakfast ""croissant"" being inedible, however, much better on the inbound flight from London.

On past sectors the older crew took the time to know you and, as a frequent flyer, even say thanks for choosing BA. Hung clothes returned crushed. The dinner was the same as Jet Airways domestic economy. Breakfast at 03.30 a bit of fruit, tepid tea, pastry and egg roll served out of alfoil.

Crew professional, no WIFI, just repeat that no WIFI, food selection limited as they had a 'catering issue'. If I booked and paid for First Class I shouldn't have to hear they had a catering issue. I had the sampler selection without the wine coupling. The portion were small so had to ask for more food from a la carte, overall the food was not fantastic.

We had front row seats 10A and 10B, 10A window seat is reverse facing and 10B is an aisle forward facing seat, the seats were very comfortable and we got a solid 8 hours sleep. We were concerned that seat 10B would get disturbance from the galley and washroom which were in front of it, however, this was not the case and would recommend this seat, it also has no one stepping over you to get out of their seat, seat 10A gives good privacy if needed by raising the divider, but you do have to step over the legs of the person in seat 11B to get out, not a huge problem but sometimes difficult when dark. Very attentive and cheery cabin crew, they maintained this good level of service for the full 13hour flight. The food was just about acceptable, champagne was offered pre take off and during flight, wine selections ok. I would be happy to travel BA Club World again on this 777-200 aircraft in seats 10AB or 10JK, but I do prefer the Upper Deck on the 747, sad will be the day they retire the good old Jumbo, I'm not a lover of the new A380.;Business Class;8.0;4.0;5.0;3.0;4.0;5.0;1
british-airways;Charles Kemp;United Kingdom;2015-07-17;LHR-BKK-LHR. Started badly with all the Ryanairesque baggage warnings at Terminal 5. BA's low 23kg baggage allowance had me nervy. Seating offered less legroom than competitors and seat not very comfy. Outward food superb, best economy meal I've had in a long time. Return trip horrible. At check-in I was under 30kg but over the 23kg derisory BA limit. Was asked for Â£65 more but declined. When I quoted Thai Airways 30kg limit I was invited to buy a ticket with them. So I had to put on loads of clothes and dump a few cheap items to get my boarding pass. On the plane I had to sit next to a very fat man (not BAs fault) and the food was disgusting. Some rubber chicken with four strips of gravy-sodden potato wedges. No vegetables. Second meal only accompanied by tasteless square of sponge. No salad, yoghurt or other goodies. Between the 2 meals a goody box was given out with an oat bar and a few other bits which was nice. IFE had the smallest screen I have ever seen, and a poor choice of films. Return flight journey progress constantly broke down. Generally, a poor experience considering BA's prices. Will not be using BA again.;Economy;2.0;1.0;2.0;3.0;1.0;1.0;0
british-airways;Richard Wilson;United Kingdom;2015-07-17;LHR-NCL-LHR economy on newly refitted Airbus narrowbody. The seats have so little legroom, it has the feeling of a budget airline (far from budget prices!) but OK for a short flight. The problem is this seat configuration is used throughout Europe and it's possible to be in such cramped conditions for a longer flight. Upgrading to business isn't a solution as there's no extra legroom on these planes. Have flown both Swiss and Norwegian in the past few weeks as well. Both had more legroom. Would recommend Norwegian (great airline - cheap, comfy, free wifi) but not Swiss (dreadful customer service). BA cabin staff continue to be very mixed : some attentive, polite and helpful. Others are downright rude (as one was on this flight) Overall, BA can be great, but sometimes not so much.;Economy;5.0;2.0;3.0;3.0;0.0;3.0;1
british-airways;Bob Motto;United Kingdom;2015-07-16;Recently flew BA from LHR to ORD, 64A, Upper Deck in Club World. Excellent experience with great service and a good food selection too. The crew were professional and very attentive but the ration of crew to passengers hels as there are only 20 seats on the upper deck with two dedicated crew. The seat was comfortable with plenty of room and storage under the windows was a great help too. The inflight entertainment was OK but the selection was very limited compared to what it used to be, BA could do more to add a much wider variety to its film selection, otherwise a great flight.;Business Class;10.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;3.0;5.0;1
british-airways;Bob Motto;United Kingdom;2015-07-16;Flew First Class 2A from Chicago to London, easy boarding and excellent service provided at all times by the cabin crew in First Class. The food was excellent and a good selection available too. Breakfast was good with a nice selection with plenty of organge juice and tea which came in a pot which was a lovely touch. If you are flying British Airways and connecting from an American Airlines domestic flight do note that you can now transfer from T3 to T5 at Chicago airside by shuttle bus which runs every 30 mins thus avoiding the security lines in T5, this applies only to BA Passengers tranferring from an American Airlines or American Eagle flight to a British Airways flight.;First Class;10.0;5.0;5.0;5.0;3.0;5.0;1
british-airways;Pauline James;United States;2015-07-15;I was amazed that this airline charges extra to book a seat in advance. I have never seen that on any of the non-discount carriers, especially in business class. When I pay for a business seat I expect that seat section will be free and I won't be charged for another $147. The b-class is not uncomfortable, just configured weirdly, with little storage space near the seat. The FAs have to constantly lean over the person in the aisle to get to the person at the window, which is annoying and probably makes extra work for them. The food was flat out lousy-it looked like bad microwave fare. The service was OK, nothing special. Although I wasn't going to watch any in-flight entertainment, I did check it out. Pretty meager selection. If given a choice, I don't think I will fly BA after this trip is over.;Business Class;4.0;2.0;3.0;1.0;1.0;2.0;0
british-airways;Robert Borman;United States;2015-07-15;First leg CAI-LHR was on time, flight crew was pleasant, but the seating was very cramped and legroom almost non-existent. The second leg LHR-JFK wasn't much different with helpful crew but horrible seating space. My knees were pressed against the seat in front of me constantly and had to relieve them one at a time. It used to be a flagship carrier but now it's not much better than a budget airline. Will do my best to avoid.;Economy;1.0;1.0;5.0;3.0;4.0;2.0;0
british-airways;N Reeves;United Kingdom;2015-07-14;Travelled in party of four with prebooked seating 4 abreast outbound, 2 abreast inbound. Cabin clean, well presented and tidy with good welcome. Not a full flight but approx 80% loading. The level of service from cabin staff was excellent. Service got underway quickly with full choice of menu and drinks available. Good, clear and short information from flight deck. Toilets were clean and tidy throughout flight. Lights dimmed two and a half hours into flight to allow rest with water rounds taking place by cabin crew. Good English breakfast served 1.5 hours out of JNB. Return flight good with attentive cabin staff and quiet cabin enabling some sleep. Food did not seem to be of such a good standard on this leg. BA on these flights provided excellent service and we were impressed. TV screens a little too small.;Economy;8.0;3.0;5.0;4.0;3.0;5.0;1
british-airways;Richard Dalgleish;United Kingdom;2015-07-14;"BA is getting more like a budget airline every time I fly. I now have to pay Â£15 to choose a seat when I book in and then wait an unreasonable time to board. Fast track were called forward first and about 80% of the passengers went that way. When I finally got to the front I asked if all the fast track were fast track and was told ""no but we are not allowed to make them go to the general boarding queue"" so what is the point. Easyjet and Norwegian are far better than BA for short haul and any Middle East airline for long haul. Try harder BA please!";Economy;3.0;3.0;3.0;4.0;0.0;2.0;0

british-airways;Alan Spencer;United Kingdom;2015-07-13;The booking of our flights was straightforward. However, when we have paid to sit next to each other, and paid for the opportunity to book seats in advance, you would expect the seating plan for the aircraft to clearly show where all the toilets and galleys are so that as the paying customer we would have a choice as to whether to is near them particularly on a long haul flight, on this occasion British Airways failed miserably. The plane was new and the seats were comfortable and spacious enough, not the upper deck in ecconomy. However being seated next to the toilets was not the best location, particularly as we had pre booked the seats online. The service was excellent and the staff helpful and happy to be there. The gluten free meals that we ordered were provided although the breakfast could have been more substantial especially after an 11 hour flight. All in all a stress free journey which was comfortable.;Economy;8.0;4.0;5.0;4.0;5.0;3.0;1
british-airways;A Ray;Australia;2015-07-12;Check in at First counter by a scruffy guy who wouldn't check my bag through on a connection. The ground crew were ordinary on First check in (nothing special) and in the lounge. Unable to answer if there was an arrivals lounge at Changi and just not interested in passengers (sorry customer) compared with comparable Qantas products. Managed to get upstairs at the last minute on BA11 (10/7). Excellent cabin crew. Couldn't have been more different than on any other sector on this trip. Interesting and interested. They couldn't understand the lack of through bag at Singapore. Good food, clean cabin, uncomfortable and dated seat so didn't sleep much. This cabin crew probably don't go on to Sydney.

british-airways;John Duffus;Thailand;2015-07-12;Having encouraged passengers to check-in online and save it staff time and money, what does BA do? It reduces the number of staff for bag drop to the barest minimum. Business class bag drop at 08:30 at Heathrow had mostly empty desks and a queue resulting in a quite unacceptable wait of more than 15 minutes. Then having raced through security, there was the almost inevitable flight delay, only this time the 40-minute delay to the incoming aircraft was a result, we were told, of someone forgetting to tow the plane on to the stand from another part of the airport! With flights taking off to the west, there was yet another 20 minutes delay during taxiing. Only crisps or a couple of sweet biscuits were offered along with drinks. Sadly the gap between the national airline and budget carriers just gets closer all the time.;Economy;3.0;2.0;4.0;1.0;0.0;3.0;0
british-airways;Leslie Percy;United Kingdom;2015-07-12;BA2678, LGW-DBV, 16/06/15, return BA2679, DBV-LGW, 27/06/15. Baggage drop very fast at the BA check in. Then had to wait 10 minutes for the the express sercurity to open didnt open at 5.30 am as stated. The lounge at Gatwick excellent, good selection of food and drinks. Priority boarding very good. The flight out very good, nothing was too much trouble for the cabin crew. On the return again fast check in, then queued for 20 minutes to get through customs (no fast check in) once through went to the lounge - ok but not as good as Gatwick. Priority boarding poor at Dubrovnik, all put on a bus to be taken to the aircraft. Cabin crew not as freindly on the return journey. Both flights about on time. The only complaint is the club europe seating, you pay a lot more for theese seats, but the legroom is the same as economy leg room. Come on BA put it back to 34 inches as you are just giving more buisness to Easyjet and Ryanair.;Business Class;8.0;4.0;4.0;5.0;0.0;4.0;1
british-airways;Ali Nike;United Kingdom;2015-07-12;Overall the journey was good. The breakfast was okay, we were served sandwiches which weren't that appetizing.

british-airways;Paul Hillsmith;United Kingdom;2015-07-11;If I could give it a Zero I would. From the moment we checked flight departure time and were incorrectly informed resulting in waiting to board for over 3 hours, to the incorrect arrival time as stated on the IFE screen. A 12 hour flight with only 1 main meal plus a snack served - without any drinks. Their idea of an Asian vegetarian meal is grilled vegetables and rice, drinks only served when the staff were either not sleeping or chatting away. Very uncomfortable hard seat, aisles so small that most passengers had their legs stuck out in the aisles and finally finishing with nearly an hour getting thru customs to then having to wait 20 minutes for my luggage.

british-airways;W Blades;Australia;2015-07-10;BA staff were excellent from the start to the finish. Service onboard was friendly, professional, and helpful. My wife left her handbag on board the plane when we arrived at Heathrow, and the BA flight attendant personally travelled from Terminal 3 to Terminal 5 to hand deliver it back to her. If you know the huge distance between terminal 3 and 5 at Heathrow, you'll know just how much effort the flight attendant put in to returning the handbag. That exceptional level of customer service is almost unheard of these days, so BA get a 100% customer care rating from my wife and I. Snacks were good given it was only a bit over 3 hours flying time. Aircraft was clean, however the only negative was the Business Class seats, in fact the tiny cramped seats was the only thing that BA should really change as it sort of killed an otherwise perfect journey. They were standard Economy Class seats cramped in tight so your knees were pressing into the seat in front. To convert these to Business Class seats all they did was put a fancy clip-in style armrest to make the row configuration 2 seats instead of 3.;Business Class;9.0;1.0;5.0;5.0;0.0;4.0;1

Flew on the same plane on the way from LHR to IST (see other recent reviews). Moved to row 1 for more space. Still sub-standard and why, why put economy seats in business class? Lounge was crammed and noisy pre-flight. I joined Star Alliance as a Gold Member so at least got to see the Miles and Smiles lounge. BA, look around don't rest on last century's efforts. I've flown BA First but just wouldn't any more. Responding to Skytrax reviews may just help increase profits. I must say, apart from the cheery crew on BA 677, the polite but totally disinterested service (when it exists) and old, cramped cabins will be my memory of this business trip.;Business Class;3.0;1.0;4.0;1.0;1.0;1.0;0
british-airways;Paul Nesbitt;Thailand;2015-07-09;All I can say is mediocre. Having flown this route with other airlines in business class, I believe I have been spoilt.

I had nothing to actually complain about, but nothing to make me want to use this product again.;Business Class;5.0;2.0;4.0;3.0;2.0;3.0;0
